In the computing education\\ncontext, these models are being used to generate code, code\\nexplanations, and programming exercises. The rapid adoption\\nof these models has prompted multiple position papers and\\nworkshops which discuss the implications of these models for\\ncomputing education, both positive and negative. This paper\\npresents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with\\n12 students and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences,\\nand preferences regarding the use of tools powered by generative\\nAI in computing classrooms. The results suggest that Generative\\nAI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant role in\\ncomputing education. However, students and instructors also\\nraised numerous concerns about how these models should be\\nintegrated to best support the needs and learning goals of\\nstudents. We also identified interesting tensions and alignments\\nthat emerged between how instructors and students prefer to\\nengage with these models. We discuss these results and provide\\nrecommendations related to curriculum development, assessment\\nmethods, and pedagogical practice. As GAI tools become in-\\ncreasingly prevalent, it’s important to understand educational\\nstakeholders’ preferences and values to ensure that these tools\\ncan be used for good and that potential harms can be mitigated.\\nIndex Terms —Generative models, large language models, com-\\nputing education, student perceptions, instructor perceptions\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nThe introduction of Generative AI (GAI) models has led\\nto significant excitement in the computing education com-\\nmunity [1]–[10]. These generative models are typically pow-\\nered by large language models such as GPT-3 or Codex\\nwhich are capable of producing code explanations [5], [6],\\n[9] that have been rated as being better than peer-generated\\nexplanations [9]. In addition, these models can solve basic\\nprogramming assignments [1], [7] and perform slightly worse\\nthan students on quizzes with multiple-choice questions [8].\\nUnderstandably, these substantial and rapid advances in the\\nperformance of generative models are causing excitementand consternation among students and instructors. A recent\\nbirds of a feather discussion at the SIGCSE conference [11]\\nhighlighted a few emerging concerns that educators have\\nrelated to over-reliance, plagiarism, and other forms of misuse.\\nThese concerns have been echoed by position papers [7], [12],\\na working group [13], and an investigation into instructor\\nperspectives [14]. However, these concerns only scratch the\\nsurface, there is an urgent need to understand students’ and\\ninstructors’ preferences about and what they want from these\\nGAI tools so that future development and regulation can align\\nwith the values of these critical stakeholders.\\nIn this paper, we conduct an interview study with 18\\nparticipants including both students (N=12) and instructors\\n(N=6). The goal of this interview study is to better understand\\nthese two key stakeholders’ awareness of these models and\\ntheir preferences about how these models should be used\\nin computing education classrooms. We are particularly in-\\nterested in what ways students and instructors envision the\\ninvolvement of generative AI in computing education, both\\npositively and negatively.\\nIn this paper, we investigate three research questions:\\nRQ1 : What preferences do instructors and students have\\nregarding how Generative AI should be used in comput-\\ning education classes?\\nRQ2 : What concerns do instructors and students have re-\\ngarding the use of Generative AI in computing education?\\nRQ3 : What implications might Generative AI have on\\ncomputing education curricula, pedagogy, and assessment\\nmethods?\\nThe results from our study suggest that students and in-\\nstructors believe computing course curricula and assessment\\nmethods should be updated to include GAI tools; however,\\nthere are important challenges which need to be addressed in\\norder to use them successfully while reducing their potential\\nharm to instructors and students alike. These results providearXiv:2308.04309v1  [cs.HC]  8 Aug 2023a timely and important snapshot of students’ and instructors’\\nperspectives and preferences which can inform the design of\\npedagogies, tools, and policies that best align with students’\\npreferences and needs.\\nII. R ELATED WORK\\nA. An AI Phase-Shift in the Classroom\\nLess than three decades ago, widespread access to the\\nInternet fundamentally changed the education landscape. As\\ninternet access in the United States rose from 14 to 77 percent,\\nstudents could suddenly access educational resources, play\\neducational games, and interact with peers in online learning\\ncommunities. This inequitable access to these resources also\\nled to a digital divide where some students were left behind\\nbecause they did not have personal computers or reliable\\ninternet access [15]. Recent advances in AI are poised to create\\na similar phase shift in the education landscape. AI-powered\\ntools are becoming ubiquitous both in online and face-to-face\\nlearning environments. From a student’s perspective, these AI-\\npowered tools provide a number of important benefits such\\nas an increased awareness of their performance, personalized\\nlearning pathways [16], and personalized support in the form\\nof intelligent tutors [17], [18]. From an instructor’s perspec-\\ntive, learning analytics tools provide instructors with the ability\\nto monitor student activity and adapt their teaching [19]–\\n[22]. Some of these tools are even integrated into classroom\\nenvironments where instructors can use augmented reality to\\nmonitor student learning, metacognition, and behavior in real-\\ntime [23]. Chen et al. discuss additional ways in which AI\\nin the classroom can be beneficial for instructors such as\\nin improving student reviews, grading, and feedback, utiliz-\\ning intelligent tutoring systems, and improving pedagogical\\npractices and student experiences using AI-powered VR for\\nexperiential or practical learning experiences [24].\\nHowever, many of these advances have been limited by\\nthe current abilities of machine learning. Recent advances in\\nmachine learning have introduced generative models capable\\nof understanding and generating code have crucial implications\\nfor computing education. Researchers are already demonstrat-\\ning the capabilities of these models to help students generate\\ncode [3], [25], [26], explain code to students [5], [6], [9],\\nand even produce programming assignments [1], [4]. However,\\nthere are also some emerging challenges related to over-\\nreliance and plagiarism [5], [11]. For instance, a recent study\\nshowed how these models can perform nearly as well as\\nstudents on multiple-choice questions [8]. So while a phase\\nshift appears to be underway, it is a critical moment to ensure\\nthat things are changing for the better and not for the worse.\\nB. Carefully Considering the Design of AI Systems\\nThe introduction of AI systems has led to new design\\nchallenges related to their probabilistic nature, their lack of\\ntransparency, and their issues related to fairness and account-\\nability. These challenges have led to rapidly evolving research\\ntopics such as explainable AI (XAI), human-AI interaction\\n(HAII), and human-centered machine learning. They havealso led to the creation of new conferences that focus on\\nfairness, accountability, and transparency. Across these fields,\\nthere is a resounding call to focus on approaches that are\\nhuman-centered [27]. For instance, XAI has grappled with\\nquestions like explainable to who and for what purpose [28].\\nAdditionally, people calibrate their trust through interactions\\nand experiences with the AI system [29]; however, other\\nfactors such as age, culture, and personality can also affect\\ntrust in AI systems [30]. Finally, there can be a tendency\\nto develop an over-reliance on AI systems which is, unfor-\\ntunately, most common for low-expertise users [31]. Based\\non these threads of research, understanding stakeholders is\\ncrucial for developing AI systems that are comprehensible,\\ntrustworthy, and avoid excessive reliance. Conversely, there\\nare many examples of AI systems that violate these principles\\nand cause harm [32].\\nNumerous computing education researchers are already ad-\\ndressing these issues of explainability, trust, and over-reliance.\\nFor instance, researchers are investigating the importance of\\nAI explainability in computing settings [33]. Khosravi et al.\\ndeveloped a new framework for XAI to guide researchers and\\npractitioners to develop AI-powered education (AIED) systems\\nthat are more trustworthy, explainable, and best aid in learners’\\neducational goals [34]. Their framework outlined 6 important\\nfactors to consider when building XAI: who the stakeholders\\nare (e.g., instructors and students), what benefits stakeholders\\nreceive from interacting with the system, what potential issues\\nstakeholders may encounter when using the system, how\\nexplanations are presented, what AI models are used, and the\\nbest ways to design user-friendly and effective AIED systems.\\nFrameworks that exist to guide the development of effective\\nAIED systems that mitigate potential harm to all stakeholders\\nare useful. However, the usage of GAI tools in education, such\\nas ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, poses a unique problem, as\\nthey were not developed solely for an educational purpose and\\ntheir inclusion in the classroom may have unknown effects.\\nMany researchers have begun to explore the potential negative\\neffects the inclusion of these models into education may bring,\\nincluding bias and fairness of these models, over-reliance,\\nexplainability, and trust [7], [11].\\nIII. M ETHODOLOGY\\nTo investigate our research questions about student and in-\\nstructor perspectives, we conducted semi-structured interviews\\nwith 18 participants. This qualitative research method is often\\nused to elicit participants’ perceptions, experiences, and values\\nregarding a particular topic or technology [35]. The field of\\ncomputing education has begun adopting interview studies\\n[36]–[39], often to explore the perspectives of instructors\\nor students with respect to topics such as instructor pain\\npoints [40] or student perspectives about online versus on-\\nsite teaching [41]. In this study, we focus on the perspectives\\nof both instructors and students because it is critical to include\\nall relevant stakeholders when considering the implications of\\nnew technology such as generative AI.A. Participant Demographics\\nWe conducted interviews with students (N=12) and instruc-\\ntors (N=6) which resulted in 18 total interviews. Participants\\nwere recruited from the Department of Computer and Informa-\\ntion Sciences at a large R1 University in the United States. The\\ninstructors included a mix of tenure-track and teaching-track\\nfaculty. Students were recruited through student organizations,\\nflyers, and snowball sampling. Student participants majored in\\neither Computer Science (11/12) or Information Science and\\nTechnology (1/12). All of the instructors interviewed taught\\ncomputer science courses.\\nB. Interview Protocol and Analysis\\nWe conducted 30-minute semi-structured interviews. Inter-\\nviews were semi-structured so that participants could partially\\nguide the conversation toward insights they believed were\\nimportant and allowed us to follow up on interesting aspects\\nof the conversation [42]. The main questions from the semi-\\nstructured interview are included in the Appendix; however,\\nwe often asked additional follow-up questions to obtain further\\ninsights and clarification from participants. Interviews were\\nrecorded and we thematically analyzed the interviews [43]\\nby reviewing the transcripts, coding participants’ insights,\\nand then identifying themes. Two researchers followed this\\nprocess independently, then compared codes in order to help\\nmitigate interpretation biases. Once the thematic analysis was\\ncompleted for all of the interviews, both researchers compared\\nand combined themes through mediation.\\nC. Limitations\\nThere is currently an urgent need to understand the im-\\nplications of generative AI in computing education. For ex-\\nample, researchers and practitioners are already raising con-\\ncerns about over-reliance, academic misconduct, and model\\ntrustworthiness [7], [12]. This work serves as an early probe\\ninto understanding current preferences, values, and concerns.\\nWhile limited in scope, our work provides a preliminary\\ninvestigation in order to help instructors, researchers, and more\\nquickly adapt to this changing landscape. There are a few\\nlimitations to our study which may impact the generalizability\\nof our results and that warrant discussion. The participants of\\nthis study, both instructors and students, came from a single\\nR1 university and represent a relatively small sample size,\\nand as such, these results may not fully represent different\\ndemographics across different universities. However, prior\\nwork has shown that results obtained from qualitative studies\\nwith small sample sizes can still provide valuable insights for\\nthe topic being researched [44], [45].\\nIV. R ESULTS - THEMES FROM STUDENT INTERVIEWS\\nIn this section, we present the themes that emerged from our\\nstudent interviews. A summarized version of the results from\\ninterviews with both stakeholders (students and instructors)\\ncan be found in Figure 1.Within each theme, we present sub-\\nthemes, our observations, relevant supporting quotes, and rela-\\ntionships between the theme and our three research questionspresented in the introduction. Despite focusing our questions\\non Generative AI (GAI) tools such as GitHub Copilot, Codex,\\nand Grammarly, our participants tended to focus on ChatGPT.\\nA. Perceived Benefits of GAI Tools (RQ1)\\nStudents shared the ways in which they have found GAI\\nTools to be beneficial in their computing courses, as well as\\ntheir potential uses in computing education.\\nGAI tools reduce the effort to write code and find\\nlearning materials. Most students (10/12) believed that GAI\\ntools, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to become, and\\nin many cases are already, valuable learning tools to reduce\\nthe effort for students and instructors to complete some\\ncommon programming tasks and find learning materials. Of\\nthe remaining two students, one was not very familiar with\\nGAI tools and was therefore unsure of their value and the\\nother actively tried to avoid using them.\\nStudents shared a number of ways in which they have found\\nGAI tools useful in the computing education context:\\n•Generating skeleton or boilerplate code (S2, S3, S8, S9)\\n•Generating explanations of code (S2, S6, S7, S10, S11)\\n•Generating examples of concepts (e.g., linked-lists, sort-\\ning algorithms) (S2, S4, S5, S6, S11)\\nReflecting on how GAI tools can generate examples to sup-\\nplement existing learning materials, S2 said,\\n“[Students] can use [ChatGPT] to find resources\\nonline... like, ‘Hey, I need a problem related to\\nbubble sort, ’ and then it will show them examples. ”\\nStudents use GAI tools to avoid busy work. When asked\\nwhat motivates students to use these tools, students who fre-\\nquently use them expressed that they were more likely to use\\nGAI tools for assisting with, or even completing, assignments\\nthat they perceived as “meaningless” or mere “busy work.”\\nSome students (4/12) compared it to existing tools, such as\\nthe calculator, whose introduction into the classroom allowed\\nstudents to progress towards more advanced topics faster and\\nreduce the amount of time students have to spend on familiar\\ntasks or could be considered tedious [46]. According to some\\nof the students, this refers to any work that takes too much of\\ntheir time for very little academic benefit or that they aren’t\\npassionate about. Participant S2 remarked on what kind of\\nwork they use ChatGPT for the most, saying,\\n“ChatGPT could just kind of do all the busy work\\nor anything I could figure out, in like a couple of\\nminutes. I’d rather ChatGPT do it, because it will. ”\\nGAI tools shift the focus to higher levels of abstraction.\\nStudents expressed (6/12) that GAI tools could help reduce the\\namount of time spent working at lower levels of abstraction.\\nStudents often gave examples of how GAI tools could shift the\\nlearner’s focus toward higher-level skills (e.g., design, the anal-\\nysis and evaluation of code, or advanced software engineering\\nconcepts) which students are more likely to encounter in later\\ncomputing courses. For example, participant S9 described how\\nstudents might focus on design patterns and software design\\nrather than implementation details. They said,Fig. 1. On the left, summarized themes from student interviews are presented and, on the right, summarized themes from instructor interviews are presented.\\n“You don’t usually get design patterns until you are\\nin graduate school, right? Unless you’d specifically\\nseek it out...we could use ChatGPT to help teach\\ndesign patterns where... You can use ChatGPT as a\\ntool to implement all the little pieces. But we are\\ngoing to try to break down this larger problem to\\nfigure out what pattern applies to it, and then use\\nwhatever you need to use to generate the individual\\npieces of code. But we really care about the overall\\nstructure and making sure that the students kind\\nof have this broader understanding of the piece of\\nsoftware rather than a single algorithm or a single\\npiece of code or a smaller scale program. ”\\nGAI tools provide alternative perspectives and sources\\nof assistance. Another common theme amongst students who\\nregularly use GAI tools is that these tools provide another\\nsource of assistance outside and their instructors and teaching\\nassistants (4/12). Some reasons why students said they choose\\nto use a tool such as ChatGPT rather than asking their\\ninstructors or teaching assistants are:\\n•Some professors are not good at explaining course con-\\ncepts and code (S4, S5)•GAI tools can provide multiple and alternative perspec-\\ntives about programming concepts (S5, S10)\\n•GAI tools can be more convenient sources of assistance\\nover instructors or TAs (S5, S8)\\nS4 described a time in which they wished they were able to\\nuse GAI tools in order to get more help with a concept in\\none of their computing courses, especially when they found\\nthemselves searching for a different perspective when they felt\\ntheir instructor wasn’t communicating what they needed,\\n“With some professors, they don’t know how to\\ncommunicate the answer that you’re looking for...\\nI had a lot of trouble wrapping my head around it\\nwhen I asked in what context will we use a linked\\nlist. [My Instructor] just explained what a linked\\nlist was, and with ChatGPT, I feel like I could say,\\n‘give me an example of a linked list and how I would\\nimplement it in this language, ’ ”\\nB. Concerns about GAI Tools (RQ2)\\nWhile students largely expressed excitement about GAI\\ntools’ benefits to computing education, students also expressed\\nan amount of trepidation and concern regarding their use in\\ncomputing education.Concerns about over-reliance. Most students (9/12) men-\\ntioned the potential for students to develop an over-reliance\\non these tools as a concern. More specifically, students (6/12)\\ndetailed their concerns about the quality of education students\\nreceive if they become over-reliant on GAI tools that don’t\\nadequately explain their responses. Some of the specific con-\\ncerns about over-reliance and the quality of education were:\\n•Students may not develop an understanding of the ma-\\nterial when they get assistance from GAI tools (S1, S4,\\nS5, S9, S11, S12)\\nThe following quotes from participants further illustrate some\\nof these student concerns. Participant S1 said,\\n“When using them I don’t really fully understand\\nwhat they’re telling me, and it’s just kind of like,\\n‘Oh! There’s the answer. ’ But I’m not really the one\\nlearning and really digesting what’s happening and\\nhow I got to that conclusion. ”\\nParticipant S4 provided an additional perspective, saying,\\n“I feel like a lot of people just heavily rely on it, and\\nthey use it to just copy and paste the work, and not\\nnecessarily understand why. I feel like they would\\njust copy the work given to them. It kind of ruins\\nthe purpose of learning it in the first place. ”\\nConcerns about trustworthiness. The majority of students\\n(7/12) also expressed concerns about the trustworthiness of\\nthe output given by GAI tools. Students raised concerns about\\nthe reliability of information generated by these models due\\nto their potential to misinform students. Specifically, students\\noutlined the following concerns about trustworthiness:\\n•Information sources are missing or incorrect (S1, S8, S9)\\n•GAI tools tend to hallucinate information (S6, S8, S10)\\n•Students have to double-check everything, not just infor-\\nmation, but things like false context and tone (S4, S6)\\nParticipant S8 said, due to these models’ tendency to hal-\\nlucinate students have to be careful to double-check the\\ninformation they receive,\\n“[ChatGPT] is helpful, but I understand that some-\\ntimes it also hallucinates as well. It will give you\\nfalse information. I don’t really know if it is yet\\nlike a Google replacement..., I feel like it’s only as\\nuseful if you really know the topic that you’re talking\\nabout, and like you can read what it’s saying, and be\\nsure that it’s not like [meaningless output], because\\nsometimes you do have to search again on Google\\njust to make sure what it said is correct. ”\\nParticipant S4 also described needing to check responses for\\ncorrectness, sharing that it wouldn’t stop them from using GAI\\ntools altogether and it prevents them from relying on the tools\\ntoo much,\\n“[Incorrect ChatGPT responses] wouldn’t keep me\\nfrom using it again. It’s just a small detail. It keeps\\nme on my toes, and makes sure I double-check\\neverything. I can’t rely too much on it. ”Concerns about academic integrity. The majority of stu-\\ndents (7/12) also brought up the issue of academic integrity.\\nThese students expressed the belief that the amount of plagia-\\nrism will increase as these tools become more popular.\\nHowever, students did not necessarily believe that AI-aided\\nplagiarism is all that different from plagiarism that occurred\\npreviously. Students claimed that the only difference between\\nplagiarizing by copying someone else’s work or paying for\\na subscription service such as Chegg and using a tool like\\nChatGPT is that it’s free and available to everyone.\\n“Before I’ve seen people use things like, Chegg, to\\njust straight up just finish their homework. I feel like\\nit’s just a difference between you using ChatGPT,\\nwhich is a free service, and it can give you the\\ninformation you want, and you could probably just\\nchange up a couple of things with it versus paying\\na fee for a subscription-based service that just hosts\\nthe work that your professors are giving to you. ”\\n(S4)\\nC. Predicted Implications of GAI Tools (RQ3)\\nStudents were excited to share their insight about how\\ncourse curricula and assessment methodologies should be\\nadapted to accommodate GAI tools.\\nInstructors are responsible for adapting their courses. In\\nour interviews, none of the students said that instructors should\\nban the use of GAI tools. On the contrary, multiple students\\n(5/12) expressed that instructors are responsible for adapting\\ntheir courses in ways to work with this new technology, as\\ninstructors have had to in the past with any innovative and\\npopular technology, such as calculators, Wikipedia, and the\\nInternet (4/12). While the majority of students expressed that\\nthey were not sure exactly what steps need to be taken by\\ninstructors in order to adapt their classes, a couple of students\\nindicated updates they hope instructors do notmake to their\\nclasses. Participants S3 and S8 specifically mentioned one way\\nto avoid plagiarism would be to increase the number of exams\\nor the weight of exams in the final grades of courses. However,\\nboth students said they would not want this,\\n“I guess they would have to possibly lower lab\\nweights and maybe increase exam weights, or you\\nknow things that can be more so tested in person... I\\nfeel like it shouldn’t be like that... I kind of had the\\nbenefit of, like, you know, being able to use Google,\\nhaving like a 40-50% like lab weight. Being able to\\nuse Google, learn, read a lot of documentation, and\\nyou know, actually, kind of somewhat suffer through\\nlabs, but also I knew that the lab grade would save\\nme because I wasn’t as good on exams, ” (S8)\\nInstructors must focus on student engagement. Several\\nstudents (3/12) specifically mentioned that, when learning new\\nmaterial, hands-on active-learning assignments are the most\\nhelpful and engaging. Students (4/12) emphasized that they\\nbelieved that engaging courses and coursework would more\\nlikely result in engaged students who see value in and wantto complete the assignments and are less likely to plagiarize.\\nParticipant S1 said the following,\\n“Instructors need to understand why students use\\nChatGPT in the first place, and some of the reasons\\nwhy they use it is they just don’t understand the\\ncontent, and they want an easy out and that means\\nthat something is going wrong with the curriculum\\nthat’s being presented to them. ”\\nInstructors should incorporate GAI tools into the classes.\\nStudents were excited about the potential for instructors to\\ninclude these models in their curricula. Students suggested\\nthat instructors could focus less on implementation details\\nand more on high-level concepts. Participant S5 pointed to\\nthe importance of other skills that should be learned in early\\nprogramming courses, particularly problem-solving.\\n“I think learning the language is the easiest part,\\nbut I think the introductory programming courses\\noffer something a little bit more important, which is\\nproblem-solving. Which I think will still ... be a very\\nimportant part of programming, because that’s really\\nall programming is. It’s just problem-solving... But\\nthe problem-solving mindset is definitely something\\nthat cannot just be assumed people have. ”\\nStudents (4/12) also suggested that instructors could teach\\nstudents how to use GAI tools by teaching students the best\\nways to prompt tools such as ChatGPT and the limitations\\nand risks of using these tools. A couple of students also\\nsuggested instructors could use GAI tools to scaffold learning,\\nas described in more detail by participant S5,\\n“It’s like asking a mathematician to do mundane\\nrepetitive math equations today without a calcula-\\ntor... yeah, you could do it, but do you want to? Not\\nreally. So, I think instructors should, you know, start\\noff teaching their students, you know, how to do it.\\nHow to do everything without an AI language model\\nto help them. And then, as they get more advanced\\nwith it, they, you know, introduce the AI to just, you\\nknow, make the more difficult tasks a bit easier. ”\\nV. R ESULTS - THEMES FROM INSTRUCTOR INTERVIEWS\\nThe following section details the themes and observations\\ndiscovered through our instructor interviews. Similar to stu-\\ndents, instructors tended to focus primarily on ChatGPT.\\nA. Perceived Benefits of GAI Tools (RQ1)\\nWhile instructors (5/6) have not used GAI tools frequently,\\nthey envision a number of ways in which they can be beneficial\\nfor students in computing courses. Overall, instructors were\\nfamiliar with GAI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot,\\nbut used them much less than students. Consequently, they\\nhad fewer insights about they might be used in the computing\\neducation context. However, every instructor (6/6) thought that\\nthese tools could be valuable for students.\\nGAI tools can help students understand code and com-\\nputing concepts. A couple of instructors (2/6) thought thatGAI tools were beneficial for students when they encounter\\nunfamiliar code and that GAI tools could provide just-in-time\\nsupport. While prior work has demonstrated the ability of\\ngenerative AI to explain code, participant I2 described how this\\nhelps students when they encounter unfamiliar code online,\\n“You can give [ChatGPT] a little piece of a program\\nyou got from Github or whatever, and have it explain\\nto you what this code is doing, and it would do a\\ngood job. ”\\nGAI tools can help students find inspiration, brainstorm,\\nand get feedback on ideas. A majority of the instructors\\n(4/6) detailed ways in which GAI tools could be used to aid\\nin creative processes such as ideation and brainstorming. For\\nexample, participant I1 described how GAI tools can help\\nwith brainstorming solutions to coding problems. Additionally,\\nsome instructors (2/6) described ways in which they’ve found\\nsuccess in having GAI tools, specifically ChatGPT, provide\\nstudents with feedback on their writing for project-based\\ncomputing courses. Participant I2 described how they’ve had\\nstudents use ChatGPT to try to find weaknesses or areas of\\nimprovement for their essays or project proposals.\\nGAI tools’ low cost and accessibility can provide stu-\\ndents with high quality learning resources. A couple of\\ninstructors (2/6) expressed their excitement about how the low\\ncost and barrier to entry can provide students with resources\\nthat can be prohibitively expensive, such as private tutors or\\npaid services such as Chegg or CourseHero. Additionally, GAI\\ntools could act as high quality learning resources outside of\\nstudents’ instructors and TAs, providing another perspective\\non course topics.\\nB. Concerns about GAI Tools (RQ2)\\nInstructors hold many common concerns regarding AI sys-\\ntems for the use of generative AI in computing education and\\ntheir use by students.\\nConcerns about trustworthiness. Most of the instructors\\n(5/6) cited the lack of trustworthiness of responses from GAI\\ntools as one of their primary concerns. All of the instructors\\nmentioned that it’s important to double-check the informa-\\ntion received from these models. However, as one instructor\\npointed out, students don’t always have the necessary foun-\\ndational knowledge to know whether the outputs are right or\\nwrong. Participant I4 said,\\n“We don’t know that [ChatGPT] is giving [students]\\nthe right information. and you know, if I know a\\ntopic, I know when I’m getting bogus information.\\nThey don’t, you know, so that’s a concern. ”\\nConcerns about over-reliance. Several instructors (3/6)\\nalso cited over-reliance as a significant concern when consid-\\nering students using these models in their classes. Participant\\nI3 expressed concern about students not fully learning material\\nif they rely too heavily on GAI tools. Participants I1 and\\nI3 both expressed concern that students may lose important\\nskills, such as writing, if they become too reliant on these\\nmodels. Participant I5 discussed their concern about GAI tools\\nreplacing students’ own effort, saying,“I think pedagogically, we’ll have to kind of go back\\nto the drawing board. And come up with new ways\\nto assess. Not necessarily just to prevent students\\nfrom using and benefiting from these tools, by all\\nmeans we should embrace change and new methods\\nand new ways of doing things. So find ways where\\nstudents can use these things to assist, to help but\\nnot one where it replaces their own cognitive load. ”\\nConcerns about academic integrity. All instructors (6/6) ex-\\npressed concern about students using GAI tools to plagiarize.\\nSeveral instructors (4/6) expressed that, due to the availability\\nand low cost of tools like ChatGPT, students are likely to\\nplagiarize more. However, one instructor (I5) said,\\n“I feel like a student who was never motivated\\nto cheat in the first place will not do it now just\\nbecause ChatGPT is available. Sufficiently motivated\\nstudents would have always cheated. So if I were to\\nlazily assume that there is an uptick in the number\\nof students who are now exploiting this tool or\\nan uptick in the number of students who are now\\ncheating as a result of this tool, it would have\\nbeen those in the middle who were always willing\\nto, but perhaps lack the time, resources, access,\\nor the know-how to properly engage in it, but I\\ndon’t think just there’s this giant movement towards\\nmore students doing it, who would not have done\\nit otherwise. I don’t think it’s turning students into\\ncheaters. I think it’s just making it more accessible\\nto those who already would have done it. ”\\nThis participant’s insight aligns with the perspectives shared\\nby the other instructors in that, the concerns about academic\\nintegrity which have arisen due to the presence of GAI tools in\\nthe classroom, are less focused on just stopping students from\\ncheating, which is unlikely, but rather in developing ways in\\nwhich instructors can disincentivize cheating.\\nC. Predicted Implications of GAI Tools (RQ3)\\nInstructors shared uncertainty about what exactly needs to\\nchange in course designs and assessment methods; however,\\nthey emphasized the importance of proactively incorporating\\nthese models into computing education curricula.\\nGAI tools should be incorporated into classrooms.\\nUnanimously, instructors (6/6) emphasized that they believe\\nGAI tools should not be banned, and they should embrace\\ntheir existence and include them in the classroom. Instructors\\nbelieved it was imperative to understand how these tools work.\\nSome of the ways they envisioned incorporating GAI tools into\\ntheir courses included:\\n•Let students use it but they should be able to explain why\\nthe output is correct or incorrect (I1, I3, I6)\\n•Clearly articulate what students need to know how to do\\nwithout using GAI tools (I4)\\nParticipant I4, detailed how, with any new tools which shift\\nhow courses are taught, clear expectations for students need\\nto be established,“... before calculators were a thing we used to expect\\nstudents to memorize multiplication and division\\ntables. And you know, after the calculator came\\ninto being, of course, you know it’s reasonable not\\nto expect people to memorize that when you know\\nthey’ve got a tool that they can use to figure out\\nhow to multiply things, you know. And I could see\\nthe same thing happening with us with programming\\nnow that tools like ChatGPT exist, you know, maybe\\nthere are certain things that we could expect students\\nto use a tool for, and we don’t have to test them on\\nit. But at the same time, you know, there has to be\\nsome core level of knowledge that we should expect\\nfrom a student, you know, without the use of tools. ”\\nGAI tools can facilitate critical thinking A couple of\\ninstructors (2/6) were excited about the potential to use these\\nmodels in their courses to help students further develop their\\ncritical thinking and analysis skills. Participant I6 said,\\n“ Let them actually use ChatGPT to come back with\\na report as a first draft. But then the job of the\\nstudent is not simply to return the report, but instead,\\nlook at the report ChatGPT wrote, and then decide\\nor criticize whether it’s right or wrong, and then,\\nif it’s wrong, then what is wrong with it, or try to\\nimprove... So in that sense, it is more useful for the\\nstudent to develop their critical thinking... instead of\\njust like the old way of just writing a report. ”\\nAdditionally, participant I5 said,\\n“Just the production of something is not going to be\\nas important, perhaps leaning more into analysis,\\nperhaps leaning more into your ability to trou-\\nbleshoot. Versus creation which is one of which is\\none of the steps that you know of many steps in any\\nsort of understanding or building a system or an\\nalgorithm or a data structure or anything else. ...It’s\\nnot, give me code, it’s, here is some code, give me\\nsome sort of analysis that matches or fits into some-\\nthing that is not easily template-tized, something that\\nis not easily described or describable. ”\\nInstructors need to update assessment methods. In terms\\nof how to update curriculum to adapt courses to account for\\nthe existence of these models, instructors did not have a very\\nclear idea of what exactly needed to be done, with many\\nexpressing uncertainty about the best way to assess student\\nprogress, prevent plagiarism, and ensure that students do not\\nrely too heavily on the models, hindering their education. In\\ntheir interviews, instructors did mention a few considerations\\nthey had for updating their assessment methods:\\n•Mitigate plagiarism by developing engaging assignments\\nand reducing busy work (I3)\\n•Change course grade weights such that easily plagiarized\\nassignments can’t carry students’ grades (I4, I5)\\n•Continue to give proctored exams since they can’t be\\nplagiarized like other out out-of-class assignments (I4)VI. D ISCUSSION & C ONCLUSION\\nA. Converging Themes across Stakeholders and Opportunities\\nIn this section, we present converging themes that emerged\\nthrough our stakeholder interviews. Based on these areas of\\nconvergence, we present some opportunities to maximize the\\nbenefits of generative models in computing education settings.\\n1) Students and instructors are concerned about trustwor-\\nthiness and over-reliance: Across most interviews, students\\nand instructors were concerned about the trustworthiness of\\nGAI tools as well as the potential for students to become over-\\nreliant on them. Participants highlighted the black-box nature\\nof GAI and their tendency to hallucinate non-factual informa-\\ntion. This raised concerns about students not understanding\\nthe responses they receive from GAI, a lack of reliability of\\nthe information received, and the impact of over-reliance on\\nstudents’ learning outcomes.\\nOpportunity #1: Explicitly teach students when and how to\\nuse GAI tools. Educators can teach courses and modules about\\nhow to fact-check the model’s output in cases where the model\\nis known to perform poorly; calibrating a healthy skepticism\\nin generative AI. Additionally, instructors should not assume\\ncomputing students have AI literacy. It may be necessary to\\nteach courses in computational thinking and AI literacy [47].\\n2) Students and instructors believe GAI tools will broaden\\naccess: Students expressed that they believed tools like Chat-\\nGPT are valuable learning tools, partially due to the fact that\\nit’s available at any time and it’s free or inexpensive to use.\\nOpportunity #2: GAI tools democratize access to help. Similar\\nto when unequal access to the Internet caused some students to\\nbe left behind [15], today, unequal financial access to tutors,\\nunpaid internships, college prep programs, and paid content\\ncan have similar effects. GAI tools may offer cheaper access\\nto high-quality tutoring.\\nB. Diverging Themes across Stakeholders and Challenges\\nIn this section, we present some diverging themes which\\nhave the potential to cause tension between students and\\ninstructors. We also describe how these divergences in prefer-\\nences may eventually lead to challenges.\\n1) Students tended to be more familiar and frequent users\\nof GAI tools than instructors: The majority of the students\\nwere either familiar with the capabilities of GAI tools or use\\nthem frequently. On the contrary, some instructors had tried\\nGAI tools, but they did not use them very frequently.\\nChallenge #1: Instructors need to become familiar with\\nthe functionality and limitations of GAI tools in order to\\nadapt curricula and assessment methods adequately. Currently,\\ninstructors are at a disadvantage to students who are much\\nmore familiar with these models.\\n2) Students and instructors are not aligned on how to adapt\\nassessment: While both stakeholders expressed uncertainty\\nabout how to adapt assessment methods to account for GAI\\ntools, the suggestions they did provide did not align. Students\\nemphasized that the weight and frequency of hands-on, active\\nlearning assignments, such as programming labs, should notchange as they are valuable to students’ comprehension of new\\nmaterial and learning goals. A few of the instructors proposed\\nto adapt their assessment methods to combat academic dishon-\\nesty by reducing the weight of some of the lab assignments\\nand increasing the weight or frequency of in-class, proctored\\nassignments, such as quizzes or tests. This divergence between\\nthe values of students and instructors has the potential to create\\nsignificant tension between students and instructors.\\nChallenge #2: Instructors wanted to develop assessments\\nthat mitigate academic dishonesty. One-third of interviewed\\ninstructors suggested doing this by increasing the weight\\nof proctored exams. However, students expressed that they\\nstill want hands-on and active learning assignments (e.g.,\\nprogramming lab assignments) to represent a larger portion\\nof their overall grade, because, as many students expressed,\\nthey learned better when they were engaged in the tasks they\\nhad to complete. Increasing the frequency or weight of in-\\nclass proctored exams moves away from evidence-based active\\nlearning [48], additionally it may negatively affect students.\\n3) Instructors were not aware of students’ motivations for\\nusing GAI tools: Students shared a variety of reasons as to\\nwhy they would choose to use GAI tools to assist with or com-\\nplete their assignments, such as reducing busy work, getting\\nanother perspective other than their instructor on a concept,\\nand getting help when their instructor is not available. When\\ninstructors were asked to consider why students use these\\nmodels, the only common response was regarding students\\nusing GAI tools for busy work.\\nChallenge #3: Instructors need to better understand stu-\\ndents’ motivations for using GAI tools. Without this un-\\nderstanding, instructors could potentially make changes to\\npedagogy and assessment that unintentionally harm students.\\nTo address this concern, researchers and practitioners could\\nco-design solutions with students. Co-design is useful for cur-\\nriculum design [49] and has already been used for integrating\\nAI into classrooms [50]. These techniques may not only result\\nin better, more equitable solutions but also have the potential\\nto build relationships and leverage students’ deeper familiarity\\nwith these GAI tools.\\nC. Conclusion\\nThis paper presents the first systematic investigation of both\\nstudents’ and instructors’ experiences with and preferences\\nfor using GAI tools in computing classrooms. While these\\nresults are preliminary, we believe that rapidly disseminating\\nthese critical views can guide researchers to capitalize on\\nopportunities while mitigating potential challenges.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nWe would like to thank Dr. Brian McInnis for feedback on\\nthe abstract which helped refine the final framing of the paper.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] S.

The rapid adoption\\nof these models has prompted multiple position papers and\\nworkshops which discuss the implications of these models for\\ncomputing education, both positive and negative. This paper\\npresents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with\\n12 students and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences,\\nand preferences regarding the use of tools powered by generative\\nAI in computing classrooms. The results suggest that Generative\\nAI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant role in\\ncomputing education. However, students and instructors also\\nraised numerous concerns about how these models should be\\nintegrated to best support the needs and learning goals of\\nstudents. We also identified interesting tensions and alignments\\nthat emerged between how instructors and students prefer to\\nengage with these models. We discuss these results and provide\\nrecommendations related to curriculum development, assessment\\nmethods, and pedagogical practice. As GAI tools become in-\\ncreasingly prevalent, it’s important to understand educational\\nstakeholders’ preferences and values to ensure that these tools\\ncan be used for good and that potential harms can be mitigated.\\nIndex Terms —Generative models, large language models, com-\\nputing education, student perceptions, instructor perceptions\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nThe introduction of Generative AI (GAI) models has led\\nto significant excitement in the computing education com-\\nmunity [1]–[10]. These generative models are typically pow-\\nered by large language models such as GPT-3 or Codex\\nwhich are capable of producing code explanations [5], [6],\\n[9] that have been rated as being better than peer-generated\\nexplanations [9]. In addition, these models can solve basic\\nprogramming assignments [1], [7] and perform slightly worse\\nthan students on quizzes with multiple-choice questions [8].\\nUnderstandably, these substantial and rapid advances in the\\nperformance of generative models are causing excitementand consternation among students and instructors. A recent\\nbirds of a feather discussion at the SIGCSE conference [11]\\nhighlighted a few emerging concerns that educators have\\nrelated to over-reliance, plagiarism, and other forms of misuse.\\nThese concerns have been echoed by position papers [7], [12],\\na working group [13], and an investigation into instructor\\nperspectives [14]. However, these concerns only scratch the\\nsurface, there is an urgent need to understand students’ and\\ninstructors’ preferences about and what they want from these\\nGAI tools so that future development and regulation can align\\nwith the values of these critical stakeholders.\\nIn this paper, we conduct an interview study with 18\\nparticipants including both students (N=12) and instructors\\n(N=6). The goal of this interview study is to better understand\\nthese two key stakeholders’ awareness of these models and\\ntheir preferences about how these models should be used\\nin computing education classrooms. We are particularly in-\\nterested in what ways students and instructors envision the\\ninvolvement of generative AI in computing education, both\\npositively and negatively.\\nIn this paper, we investigate three research questions:\\nRQ1 : What preferences do instructors and students have\\nregarding how Generative AI should be used in comput-\\ning education classes?\\nRQ2 : What concerns do instructors and students have re-\\ngarding the use of Generative AI in computing education?\\nRQ3 : What implications might Generative AI have on\\ncomputing education curricula, pedagogy, and assessment\\nmethods?\\nThe results from our study suggest that students and in-\\nstructors believe computing course curricula and assessment\\nmethods should be updated to include GAI tools; however,\\nthere are important challenges which need to be addressed in\\norder to use them successfully while reducing their potential\\nharm to instructors and students alike. These results providearXiv:2308.04309v1  [cs.HC]  8 Aug 2023a timely and important snapshot of students’ and instructors’\\nperspectives and preferences which can inform the design of\\npedagogies, tools, and policies that best align with students’\\npreferences and needs.\\nII. R ELATED WORK\\nA. An AI Phase-Shift in the Classroom\\nLess than three decades ago, widespread access to the\\nInternet fundamentally changed the education landscape. As\\ninternet access in the United States rose from 14 to 77 percent,\\nstudents could suddenly access educational resources, play\\neducational games, and interact with peers in online learning\\ncommunities. This inequitable access to these resources also\\nled to a digital divide where some students were left behind\\nbecause they did not have personal computers or reliable\\ninternet access [15]. Recent advances in AI are poised to create\\na similar phase shift in the education landscape. AI-powered\\ntools are becoming ubiquitous both in online and face-to-face\\nlearning environments. From a student’s perspective, these AI-\\npowered tools provide a number of important benefits such\\nas an increased awareness of their performance, personalized\\nlearning pathways [16], and personalized support in the form\\nof intelligent tutors [17], [18]. From an instructor’s perspec-\\ntive, learning analytics tools provide instructors with the ability\\nto monitor student activity and adapt their teaching [19]–\\n[22]. Some of these tools are even integrated into classroom\\nenvironments where instructors can use augmented reality to\\nmonitor student learning, metacognition, and behavior in real-\\ntime [23]. Chen et al. discuss additional ways in which AI\\nin the classroom can be beneficial for instructors such as\\nin improving student reviews, grading, and feedback, utiliz-\\ning intelligent tutoring systems, and improving pedagogical\\npractices and student experiences using AI-powered VR for\\nexperiential or practical learning experiences [24].\\nHowever, many of these advances have been limited by\\nthe current abilities of machine learning. Recent advances in\\nmachine learning have introduced generative models capable\\nof understanding and generating code have crucial implications\\nfor computing education. Researchers are already demonstrat-\\ning the capabilities of these models to help students generate\\ncode [3], [25], [26], explain code to students [5], [6], [9],\\nand even produce programming assignments [1], [4]. However,\\nthere are also some emerging challenges related to over-\\nreliance and plagiarism [5], [11]. For instance, a recent study\\nshowed how these models can perform nearly as well as\\nstudents on multiple-choice questions [8]. So while a phase\\nshift appears to be underway, it is a critical moment to ensure\\nthat things are changing for the better and not for the worse.\\nB. Carefully Considering the Design of AI Systems\\nThe introduction of AI systems has led to new design\\nchallenges related to their probabilistic nature, their lack of\\ntransparency, and their issues related to fairness and account-\\nability. These challenges have led to rapidly evolving research\\ntopics such as explainable AI (XAI), human-AI interaction\\n(HAII), and human-centered machine learning. They havealso led to the creation of new conferences that focus on\\nfairness, accountability, and transparency. Across these fields,\\nthere is a resounding call to focus on approaches that are\\nhuman-centered [27]. For instance, XAI has grappled with\\nquestions like explainable to who and for what purpose [28].\\nAdditionally, people calibrate their trust through interactions\\nand experiences with the AI system [29]; however, other\\nfactors such as age, culture, and personality can also affect\\ntrust in AI systems [30]. Finally, there can be a tendency\\nto develop an over-reliance on AI systems which is, unfor-\\ntunately, most common for low-expertise users [31]. Based\\non these threads of research, understanding stakeholders is\\ncrucial for developing AI systems that are comprehensible,\\ntrustworthy, and avoid excessive reliance. Conversely, there\\nare many examples of AI systems that violate these principles\\nand cause harm [32].\\nNumerous computing education researchers are already ad-\\ndressing these issues of explainability, trust, and over-reliance.\\nFor instance, researchers are investigating the importance of\\nAI explainability in computing settings [33]. Khosravi et al.\\ndeveloped a new framework for XAI to guide researchers and\\npractitioners to develop AI-powered education (AIED) systems\\nthat are more trustworthy, explainable, and best aid in learners’\\neducational goals [34]. Their framework outlined 6 important\\nfactors to consider when building XAI: who the stakeholders\\nare (e.g., instructors and students), what benefits stakeholders\\nreceive from interacting with the system, what potential issues\\nstakeholders may encounter when using the system, how\\nexplanations are presented, what AI models are used, and the\\nbest ways to design user-friendly and effective AIED systems.\\nFrameworks that exist to guide the development of effective\\nAIED systems that mitigate potential harm to all stakeholders\\nare useful. However, the usage of GAI tools in education, such\\nas ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, poses a unique problem, as\\nthey were not developed solely for an educational purpose and\\ntheir inclusion in the classroom may have unknown effects.\\nMany researchers have begun to explore the potential negative\\neffects the inclusion of these models into education may bring,\\nincluding bias and fairness of these models, over-reliance,\\nexplainability, and trust [7], [11].\\nIII. M ETHODOLOGY\\nTo investigate our research questions about student and in-\\nstructor perspectives, we conducted semi-structured interviews\\nwith 18 participants. This qualitative research method is often\\nused to elicit participants’ perceptions, experiences, and values\\nregarding a particular topic or technology [35]. The field of\\ncomputing education has begun adopting interview studies\\n[36]–[39], often to explore the perspectives of instructors\\nor students with respect to topics such as instructor pain\\npoints [40] or student perspectives about online versus on-\\nsite teaching [41]. In this study, we focus on the perspectives\\nof both instructors and students because it is critical to include\\nall relevant stakeholders when considering the implications of\\nnew technology such as generative AI.A. Participant Demographics\\nWe conducted interviews with students (N=12) and instruc-\\ntors (N=6) which resulted in 18 total interviews. Participants\\nwere recruited from the Department of Computer and Informa-\\ntion Sciences at a large R1 University in the United States. The\\ninstructors included a mix of tenure-track and teaching-track\\nfaculty. Students were recruited through student organizations,\\nflyers, and snowball sampling. Student participants majored in\\neither Computer Science (11/12) or Information Science and\\nTechnology (1/12). All of the instructors interviewed taught\\ncomputer science courses.\\nB. Interview Protocol and Analysis\\nWe conducted 30-minute semi-structured interviews. Inter-\\nviews were semi-structured so that participants could partially\\nguide the conversation toward insights they believed were\\nimportant and allowed us to follow up on interesting aspects\\nof the conversation [42]. The main questions from the semi-\\nstructured interview are included in the Appendix; however,\\nwe often asked additional follow-up questions to obtain further\\ninsights and clarification from participants. Interviews were\\nrecorded and we thematically analyzed the interviews [43]\\nby reviewing the transcripts, coding participants’ insights,\\nand then identifying themes. Two researchers followed this\\nprocess independently, then compared codes in order to help\\nmitigate interpretation biases. Once the thematic analysis was\\ncompleted for all of the interviews, both researchers compared\\nand combined themes through mediation.\\nC. Limitations\\nThere is currently an urgent need to understand the im-\\nplications of generative AI in computing education. For ex-\\nample, researchers and practitioners are already raising con-\\ncerns about over-reliance, academic misconduct, and model\\ntrustworthiness [7], [12]. This work serves as an early probe\\ninto understanding current preferences, values, and concerns.\\nWhile limited in scope, our work provides a preliminary\\ninvestigation in order to help instructors, researchers, and more\\nquickly adapt to this changing landscape. There are a few\\nlimitations to our study which may impact the generalizability\\nof our results and that warrant discussion. The participants of\\nthis study, both instructors and students, came from a single\\nR1 university and represent a relatively small sample size,\\nand as such, these results may not fully represent different\\ndemographics across different universities. However, prior\\nwork has shown that results obtained from qualitative studies\\nwith small sample sizes can still provide valuable insights for\\nthe topic being researched [44], [45].\\nIV. R ESULTS - THEMES FROM STUDENT INTERVIEWS\\nIn this section, we present the themes that emerged from our\\nstudent interviews. A summarized version of the results from\\ninterviews with both stakeholders (students and instructors)\\ncan be found in Figure 1.Within each theme, we present sub-\\nthemes, our observations, relevant supporting quotes, and rela-\\ntionships between the theme and our three research questionspresented in the introduction. Despite focusing our questions\\non Generative AI (GAI) tools such as GitHub Copilot, Codex,\\nand Grammarly, our participants tended to focus on ChatGPT.\\nA. Perceived Benefits of GAI Tools (RQ1)\\nStudents shared the ways in which they have found GAI\\nTools to be beneficial in their computing courses, as well as\\ntheir potential uses in computing education.\\nGAI tools reduce the effort to write code and find\\nlearning materials. Most students (10/12) believed that GAI\\ntools, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to become, and\\nin many cases are already, valuable learning tools to reduce\\nthe effort for students and instructors to complete some\\ncommon programming tasks and find learning materials. Of\\nthe remaining two students, one was not very familiar with\\nGAI tools and was therefore unsure of their value and the\\nother actively tried to avoid using them.\\nStudents shared a number of ways in which they have found\\nGAI tools useful in the computing education context:\\n•Generating skeleton or boilerplate code (S2, S3, S8, S9)\\n•Generating explanations of code (S2, S6, S7, S10, S11)\\n•Generating examples of concepts (e.g., linked-lists, sort-\\ning algorithms) (S2, S4, S5, S6, S11)\\nReflecting on how GAI tools can generate examples to sup-\\nplement existing learning materials, S2 said,\\n“[Students] can use [ChatGPT] to find resources\\nonline... like, ‘Hey, I need a problem related to\\nbubble sort, ’ and then it will show them examples. ”\\nStudents use GAI tools to avoid busy work. When asked\\nwhat motivates students to use these tools, students who fre-\\nquently use them expressed that they were more likely to use\\nGAI tools for assisting with, or even completing, assignments\\nthat they perceived as “meaningless” or mere “busy work.”\\nSome students (4/12) compared it to existing tools, such as\\nthe calculator, whose introduction into the classroom allowed\\nstudents to progress towards more advanced topics faster and\\nreduce the amount of time students have to spend on familiar\\ntasks or could be considered tedious [46]. According to some\\nof the students, this refers to any work that takes too much of\\ntheir time for very little academic benefit or that they aren’t\\npassionate about. Participant S2 remarked on what kind of\\nwork they use ChatGPT for the most, saying,\\n“ChatGPT could just kind of do all the busy work\\nor anything I could figure out, in like a couple of\\nminutes. I’d rather ChatGPT do it, because it will. ”\\nGAI tools shift the focus to higher levels of abstraction.\\nStudents expressed (6/12) that GAI tools could help reduce the\\namount of time spent working at lower levels of abstraction.\\nStudents often gave examples of how GAI tools could shift the\\nlearner’s focus toward higher-level skills (e.g., design, the anal-\\nysis and evaluation of code, or advanced software engineering\\nconcepts) which students are more likely to encounter in later\\ncomputing courses. For example, participant S9 described how\\nstudents might focus on design patterns and software design\\nrather than implementation details. They said,Fig. 1. On the left, summarized themes from student interviews are presented and, on the right, summarized themes from instructor interviews are presented.\\n“You don’t usually get design patterns until you are\\nin graduate school, right? Unless you’d specifically\\nseek it out...we could use ChatGPT to help teach\\ndesign patterns where... You can use ChatGPT as a\\ntool to implement all the little pieces. But we are\\ngoing to try to break down this larger problem to\\nfigure out what pattern applies to it, and then use\\nwhatever you need to use to generate the individual\\npieces of code. But we really care about the overall\\nstructure and making sure that the students kind\\nof have this broader understanding of the piece of\\nsoftware rather than a single algorithm or a single\\npiece of code or a smaller scale program. ”\\nGAI tools provide alternative perspectives and sources\\nof assistance. Another common theme amongst students who\\nregularly use GAI tools is that these tools provide another\\nsource of assistance outside and their instructors and teaching\\nassistants (4/12). Some reasons why students said they choose\\nto use a tool such as ChatGPT rather than asking their\\ninstructors or teaching assistants are:\\n•Some professors are not good at explaining course con-\\ncepts and code (S4, S5)•GAI tools can provide multiple and alternative perspec-\\ntives about programming concepts (S5, S10)\\n•GAI tools can be more convenient sources of assistance\\nover instructors or TAs (S5, S8)\\nS4 described a time in which they wished they were able to\\nuse GAI tools in order to get more help with a concept in\\none of their computing courses, especially when they found\\nthemselves searching for a different perspective when they felt\\ntheir instructor wasn’t communicating what they needed,\\n“With some professors, they don’t know how to\\ncommunicate the answer that you’re looking for...\\nI had a lot of trouble wrapping my head around it\\nwhen I asked in what context will we use a linked\\nlist. [My Instructor] just explained what a linked\\nlist was, and with ChatGPT, I feel like I could say,\\n‘give me an example of a linked list and how I would\\nimplement it in this language, ’ ”\\nB. Concerns about GAI Tools (RQ2)\\nWhile students largely expressed excitement about GAI\\ntools’ benefits to computing education, students also expressed\\nan amount of trepidation and concern regarding their use in\\ncomputing education.Concerns about over-reliance. Most students (9/12) men-\\ntioned the potential for students to develop an over-reliance\\non these tools as a concern. More specifically, students (6/12)\\ndetailed their concerns about the quality of education students\\nreceive if they become over-reliant on GAI tools that don’t\\nadequately explain their responses. Some of the specific con-\\ncerns about over-reliance and the quality of education were:\\n•Students may not develop an understanding of the ma-\\nterial when they get assistance from GAI tools (S1, S4,\\nS5, S9, S11, S12)\\nThe following quotes from participants further illustrate some\\nof these student concerns. Participant S1 said,\\n“When using them I don’t really fully understand\\nwhat they’re telling me, and it’s just kind of like,\\n‘Oh! There’s the answer. ’ But I’m not really the one\\nlearning and really digesting what’s happening and\\nhow I got to that conclusion. ”\\nParticipant S4 provided an additional perspective, saying,\\n“I feel like a lot of people just heavily rely on it, and\\nthey use it to just copy and paste the work, and not\\nnecessarily understand why. I feel like they would\\njust copy the work given to them. It kind of ruins\\nthe purpose of learning it in the first place. ”\\nConcerns about trustworthiness. The majority of students\\n(7/12) also expressed concerns about the trustworthiness of\\nthe output given by GAI tools. Students raised concerns about\\nthe reliability of information generated by these models due\\nto their potential to misinform students. Specifically, students\\noutlined the following concerns about trustworthiness:\\n•Information sources are missing or incorrect (S1, S8, S9)\\n•GAI tools tend to hallucinate information (S6, S8, S10)\\n•Students have to double-check everything, not just infor-\\nmation, but things like false context and tone (S4, S6)\\nParticipant S8 said, due to these models’ tendency to hal-\\nlucinate students have to be careful to double-check the\\ninformation they receive,\\n“[ChatGPT] is helpful, but I understand that some-\\ntimes it also hallucinates as well. It will give you\\nfalse information. I don’t really know if it is yet\\nlike a Google replacement..., I feel like it’s only as\\nuseful if you really know the topic that you’re talking\\nabout, and like you can read what it’s saying, and be\\nsure that it’s not like [meaningless output], because\\nsometimes you do have to search again on Google\\njust to make sure what it said is correct. ”\\nParticipant S4 also described needing to check responses for\\ncorrectness, sharing that it wouldn’t stop them from using GAI\\ntools altogether and it prevents them from relying on the tools\\ntoo much,\\n“[Incorrect ChatGPT responses] wouldn’t keep me\\nfrom using it again. It’s just a small detail. It keeps\\nme on my toes, and makes sure I double-check\\neverything. I can’t rely too much on it. ”Concerns about academic integrity. The majority of stu-\\ndents (7/12) also brought up the issue of academic integrity.\\nThese students expressed the belief that the amount of plagia-\\nrism will increase as these tools become more popular.\\nHowever, students did not necessarily believe that AI-aided\\nplagiarism is all that different from plagiarism that occurred\\npreviously. Students claimed that the only difference between\\nplagiarizing by copying someone else’s work or paying for\\na subscription service such as Chegg and using a tool like\\nChatGPT is that it’s free and available to everyone.\\n“Before I’ve seen people use things like, Chegg, to\\njust straight up just finish their homework. I feel like\\nit’s just a difference between you using ChatGPT,\\nwhich is a free service, and it can give you the\\ninformation you want, and you could probably just\\nchange up a couple of things with it versus paying\\na fee for a subscription-based service that just hosts\\nthe work that your professors are giving to you. ”\\n(S4)\\nC. Predicted Implications of GAI Tools (RQ3)\\nStudents were excited to share their insight about how\\ncourse curricula and assessment methodologies should be\\nadapted to accommodate GAI tools.\\nInstructors are responsible for adapting their courses. In\\nour interviews, none of the students said that instructors should\\nban the use of GAI tools. On the contrary, multiple students\\n(5/12) expressed that instructors are responsible for adapting\\ntheir courses in ways to work with this new technology, as\\ninstructors have had to in the past with any innovative and\\npopular technology, such as calculators, Wikipedia, and the\\nInternet (4/12). While the majority of students expressed that\\nthey were not sure exactly what steps need to be taken by\\ninstructors in order to adapt their classes, a couple of students\\nindicated updates they hope instructors do notmake to their\\nclasses. Participants S3 and S8 specifically mentioned one way\\nto avoid plagiarism would be to increase the number of exams\\nor the weight of exams in the final grades of courses. However,\\nboth students said they would not want this,\\n“I guess they would have to possibly lower lab\\nweights and maybe increase exam weights, or you\\nknow things that can be more so tested in person... I\\nfeel like it shouldn’t be like that... I kind of had the\\nbenefit of, like, you know, being able to use Google,\\nhaving like a 40-50% like lab weight. Being able to\\nuse Google, learn, read a lot of documentation, and\\nyou know, actually, kind of somewhat suffer through\\nlabs, but also I knew that the lab grade would save\\nme because I wasn’t as good on exams, ” (S8)\\nInstructors must focus on student engagement. Several\\nstudents (3/12) specifically mentioned that, when learning new\\nmaterial, hands-on active-learning assignments are the most\\nhelpful and engaging. Students (4/12) emphasized that they\\nbelieved that engaging courses and coursework would more\\nlikely result in engaged students who see value in and wantto complete the assignments and are less likely to plagiarize.\\nParticipant S1 said the following,\\n“Instructors need to understand why students use\\nChatGPT in the first place, and some of the reasons\\nwhy they use it is they just don’t understand the\\ncontent, and they want an easy out and that means\\nthat something is going wrong with the curriculum\\nthat’s being presented to them. ”\\nInstructors should incorporate GAI tools into the classes.\\nStudents were excited about the potential for instructors to\\ninclude these models in their curricula. Students suggested\\nthat instructors could focus less on implementation details\\nand more on high-level concepts. Participant S5 pointed to\\nthe importance of other skills that should be learned in early\\nprogramming courses, particularly problem-solving.\\n“I think learning the language is the easiest part,\\nbut I think the introductory programming courses\\noffer something a little bit more important, which is\\nproblem-solving. Which I think will still ... be a very\\nimportant part of programming, because that’s really\\nall programming is. It’s just problem-solving... But\\nthe problem-solving mindset is definitely something\\nthat cannot just be assumed people have. ”\\nStudents (4/12) also suggested that instructors could teach\\nstudents how to use GAI tools by teaching students the best\\nways to prompt tools such as ChatGPT and the limitations\\nand risks of using these tools. A couple of students also\\nsuggested instructors could use GAI tools to scaffold learning,\\nas described in more detail by participant S5,\\n“It’s like asking a mathematician to do mundane\\nrepetitive math equations today without a calcula-\\ntor... yeah, you could do it, but do you want to? Not\\nreally. So, I think instructors should, you know, start\\noff teaching their students, you know, how to do it.\\nHow to do everything without an AI language model\\nto help them. And then, as they get more advanced\\nwith it, they, you know, introduce the AI to just, you\\nknow, make the more difficult tasks a bit easier. ”\\nV. R ESULTS - THEMES FROM INSTRUCTOR INTERVIEWS\\nThe following section details the themes and observations\\ndiscovered through our instructor interviews. Similar to stu-\\ndents, instructors tended to focus primarily on ChatGPT.\\nA. Perceived Benefits of GAI Tools (RQ1)\\nWhile instructors (5/6) have not used GAI tools frequently,\\nthey envision a number of ways in which they can be beneficial\\nfor students in computing courses. Overall, instructors were\\nfamiliar with GAI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot,\\nbut used them much less than students. Consequently, they\\nhad fewer insights about they might be used in the computing\\neducation context. However, every instructor (6/6) thought that\\nthese tools could be valuable for students.\\nGAI tools can help students understand code and com-\\nputing concepts. A couple of instructors (2/6) thought thatGAI tools were beneficial for students when they encounter\\nunfamiliar code and that GAI tools could provide just-in-time\\nsupport. While prior work has demonstrated the ability of\\ngenerative AI to explain code, participant I2 described how this\\nhelps students when they encounter unfamiliar code online,\\n“You can give [ChatGPT] a little piece of a program\\nyou got from Github or whatever, and have it explain\\nto you what this code is doing, and it would do a\\ngood job. ”\\nGAI tools can help students find inspiration, brainstorm,\\nand get feedback on ideas. A majority of the instructors\\n(4/6) detailed ways in which GAI tools could be used to aid\\nin creative processes such as ideation and brainstorming. For\\nexample, participant I1 described how GAI tools can help\\nwith brainstorming solutions to coding problems. Additionally,\\nsome instructors (2/6) described ways in which they’ve found\\nsuccess in having GAI tools, specifically ChatGPT, provide\\nstudents with feedback on their writing for project-based\\ncomputing courses. Participant I2 described how they’ve had\\nstudents use ChatGPT to try to find weaknesses or areas of\\nimprovement for their essays or project proposals.\\nGAI tools’ low cost and accessibility can provide stu-\\ndents with high quality learning resources. A couple of\\ninstructors (2/6) expressed their excitement about how the low\\ncost and barrier to entry can provide students with resources\\nthat can be prohibitively expensive, such as private tutors or\\npaid services such as Chegg or CourseHero. Additionally, GAI\\ntools could act as high quality learning resources outside of\\nstudents’ instructors and TAs, providing another perspective\\non course topics.\\nB. Concerns about GAI Tools (RQ2)\\nInstructors hold many common concerns regarding AI sys-\\ntems for the use of generative AI in computing education and\\ntheir use by students.\\nConcerns about trustworthiness. Most of the instructors\\n(5/6) cited the lack of trustworthiness of responses from GAI\\ntools as one of their primary concerns. All of the instructors\\nmentioned that it’s important to double-check the informa-\\ntion received from these models. However, as one instructor\\npointed out, students don’t always have the necessary foun-\\ndational knowledge to know whether the outputs are right or\\nwrong. Participant I4 said,\\n“We don’t know that [ChatGPT] is giving [students]\\nthe right information. and you know, if I know a\\ntopic, I know when I’m getting bogus information.\\nThey don’t, you know, so that’s a concern. ”\\nConcerns about over-reliance. Several instructors (3/6)\\nalso cited over-reliance as a significant concern when consid-\\nering students using these models in their classes. Participant\\nI3 expressed concern about students not fully learning material\\nif they rely too heavily on GAI tools. Participants I1 and\\nI3 both expressed concern that students may lose important\\nskills, such as writing, if they become too reliant on these\\nmodels. Participant I5 discussed their concern about GAI tools\\nreplacing students’ own effort, saying,“I think pedagogically, we’ll have to kind of go back\\nto the drawing board. And come up with new ways\\nto assess. Not necessarily just to prevent students\\nfrom using and benefiting from these tools, by all\\nmeans we should embrace change and new methods\\nand new ways of doing things. So find ways where\\nstudents can use these things to assist, to help but\\nnot one where it replaces their own cognitive load. ”\\nConcerns about academic integrity. All instructors (6/6) ex-\\npressed concern about students using GAI tools to plagiarize.\\nSeveral instructors (4/6) expressed that, due to the availability\\nand low cost of tools like ChatGPT, students are likely to\\nplagiarize more. However, one instructor (I5) said,\\n“I feel like a student who was never motivated\\nto cheat in the first place will not do it now just\\nbecause ChatGPT is available. Sufficiently motivated\\nstudents would have always cheated. So if I were to\\nlazily assume that there is an uptick in the number\\nof students who are now exploiting this tool or\\nan uptick in the number of students who are now\\ncheating as a result of this tool, it would have\\nbeen those in the middle who were always willing\\nto, but perhaps lack the time, resources, access,\\nor the know-how to properly engage in it, but I\\ndon’t think just there’s this giant movement towards\\nmore students doing it, who would not have done\\nit otherwise. I don’t think it’s turning students into\\ncheaters. I think it’s just making it more accessible\\nto those who already would have done it. ”\\nThis participant’s insight aligns with the perspectives shared\\nby the other instructors in that, the concerns about academic\\nintegrity which have arisen due to the presence of GAI tools in\\nthe classroom, are less focused on just stopping students from\\ncheating, which is unlikely, but rather in developing ways in\\nwhich instructors can disincentivize cheating.\\nC. Predicted Implications of GAI Tools (RQ3)\\nInstructors shared uncertainty about what exactly needs to\\nchange in course designs and assessment methods; however,\\nthey emphasized the importance of proactively incorporating\\nthese models into computing education curricula.\\nGAI tools should be incorporated into classrooms.\\nUnanimously, instructors (6/6) emphasized that they believe\\nGAI tools should not be banned, and they should embrace\\ntheir existence and include them in the classroom. Instructors\\nbelieved it was imperative to understand how these tools work.\\nSome of the ways they envisioned incorporating GAI tools into\\ntheir courses included:\\n•Let students use it but they should be able to explain why\\nthe output is correct or incorrect (I1, I3, I6)\\n•Clearly articulate what students need to know how to do\\nwithout using GAI tools (I4)\\nParticipant I4, detailed how, with any new tools which shift\\nhow courses are taught, clear expectations for students need\\nto be established,“... before calculators were a thing we used to expect\\nstudents to memorize multiplication and division\\ntables. And you know, after the calculator came\\ninto being, of course, you know it’s reasonable not\\nto expect people to memorize that when you know\\nthey’ve got a tool that they can use to figure out\\nhow to multiply things, you know. And I could see\\nthe same thing happening with us with programming\\nnow that tools like ChatGPT exist, you know, maybe\\nthere are certain things that we could expect students\\nto use a tool for, and we don’t have to test them on\\nit. But at the same time, you know, there has to be\\nsome core level of knowledge that we should expect\\nfrom a student, you know, without the use of tools. ”\\nGAI tools can facilitate critical thinking A couple of\\ninstructors (2/6) were excited about the potential to use these\\nmodels in their courses to help students further develop their\\ncritical thinking and analysis skills. Participant I6 said,\\n“ Let them actually use ChatGPT to come back with\\na report as a first draft. But then the job of the\\nstudent is not simply to return the report, but instead,\\nlook at the report ChatGPT wrote, and then decide\\nor criticize whether it’s right or wrong, and then,\\nif it’s wrong, then what is wrong with it, or try to\\nimprove... So in that sense, it is more useful for the\\nstudent to develop their critical thinking... instead of\\njust like the old way of just writing a report. ”\\nAdditionally, participant I5 said,\\n“Just the production of something is not going to be\\nas important, perhaps leaning more into analysis,\\nperhaps leaning more into your ability to trou-\\nbleshoot. Versus creation which is one of which is\\none of the steps that you know of many steps in any\\nsort of understanding or building a system or an\\nalgorithm or a data structure or anything else. ...It’s\\nnot, give me code, it’s, here is some code, give me\\nsome sort of analysis that matches or fits into some-\\nthing that is not easily template-tized, something that\\nis not easily described or describable. ”\\nInstructors need to update assessment methods. In terms\\nof how to update curriculum to adapt courses to account for\\nthe existence of these models, instructors did not have a very\\nclear idea of what exactly needed to be done, with many\\nexpressing uncertainty about the best way to assess student\\nprogress, prevent plagiarism, and ensure that students do not\\nrely too heavily on the models, hindering their education. In\\ntheir interviews, instructors did mention a few considerations\\nthey had for updating their assessment methods:\\n•Mitigate plagiarism by developing engaging assignments\\nand reducing busy work (I3)\\n•Change course grade weights such that easily plagiarized\\nassignments can’t carry students’ grades (I4, I5)\\n•Continue to give proctored exams since they can’t be\\nplagiarized like other out out-of-class assignments (I4)VI. D ISCUSSION & C ONCLUSION\\nA. Converging Themes across Stakeholders and Opportunities\\nIn this section, we present converging themes that emerged\\nthrough our stakeholder interviews. Based on these areas of\\nconvergence, we present some opportunities to maximize the\\nbenefits of generative models in computing education settings.\\n1) Students and instructors are concerned about trustwor-\\nthiness and over-reliance: Across most interviews, students\\nand instructors were concerned about the trustworthiness of\\nGAI tools as well as the potential for students to become over-\\nreliant on them. Participants highlighted the black-box nature\\nof GAI and their tendency to hallucinate non-factual informa-\\ntion. This raised concerns about students not understanding\\nthe responses they receive from GAI, a lack of reliability of\\nthe information received, and the impact of over-reliance on\\nstudents’ learning outcomes.\\nOpportunity #1: Explicitly teach students when and how to\\nuse GAI tools. Educators can teach courses and modules about\\nhow to fact-check the model’s output in cases where the model\\nis known to perform poorly; calibrating a healthy skepticism\\nin generative AI. Additionally, instructors should not assume\\ncomputing students have AI literacy. It may be necessary to\\nteach courses in computational thinking and AI literacy [47].\\n2) Students and instructors believe GAI tools will broaden\\naccess: Students expressed that they believed tools like Chat-\\nGPT are valuable learning tools, partially due to the fact that\\nit’s available at any time and it’s free or inexpensive to use.\\nOpportunity #2: GAI tools democratize access to help. Similar\\nto when unequal access to the Internet caused some students to\\nbe left behind [15], today, unequal financial access to tutors,\\nunpaid internships, college prep programs, and paid content\\ncan have similar effects. GAI tools may offer cheaper access\\nto high-quality tutoring.\\nB. Diverging Themes across Stakeholders and Challenges\\nIn this section, we present some diverging themes which\\nhave the potential to cause tension between students and\\ninstructors. We also describe how these divergences in prefer-\\nences may eventually lead to challenges.\\n1) Students tended to be more familiar and frequent users\\nof GAI tools than instructors: The majority of the students\\nwere either familiar with the capabilities of GAI tools or use\\nthem frequently. On the contrary, some instructors had tried\\nGAI tools, but they did not use them very frequently.\\nChallenge #1: Instructors need to become familiar with\\nthe functionality and limitations of GAI tools in order to\\nadapt curricula and assessment methods adequately. Currently,\\ninstructors are at a disadvantage to students who are much\\nmore familiar with these models.\\n2) Students and instructors are not aligned on how to adapt\\nassessment: While both stakeholders expressed uncertainty\\nabout how to adapt assessment methods to account for GAI\\ntools, the suggestions they did provide did not align. Students\\nemphasized that the weight and frequency of hands-on, active\\nlearning assignments, such as programming labs, should notchange as they are valuable to students’ comprehension of new\\nmaterial and learning goals. A few of the instructors proposed\\nto adapt their assessment methods to combat academic dishon-\\nesty by reducing the weight of some of the lab assignments\\nand increasing the weight or frequency of in-class, proctored\\nassignments, such as quizzes or tests. This divergence between\\nthe values of students and instructors has the potential to create\\nsignificant tension between students and instructors.\\nChallenge #2: Instructors wanted to develop assessments\\nthat mitigate academic dishonesty. One-third of interviewed\\ninstructors suggested doing this by increasing the weight\\nof proctored exams. However, students expressed that they\\nstill want hands-on and active learning assignments (e.g.,\\nprogramming lab assignments) to represent a larger portion\\nof their overall grade, because, as many students expressed,\\nthey learned better when they were engaged in the tasks they\\nhad to complete. Increasing the frequency or weight of in-\\nclass proctored exams moves away from evidence-based active\\nlearning [48], additionally it may negatively affect students.\\n3) Instructors were not aware of students’ motivations for\\nusing GAI tools: Students shared a variety of reasons as to\\nwhy they would choose to use GAI tools to assist with or com-\\nplete their assignments, such as reducing busy work, getting\\nanother perspective other than their instructor on a concept,\\nand getting help when their instructor is not available. When\\ninstructors were asked to consider why students use these\\nmodels, the only common response was regarding students\\nusing GAI tools for busy work.\\nChallenge #3: Instructors need to better understand stu-\\ndents’ motivations for using GAI tools. Without this un-\\nderstanding, instructors could potentially make changes to\\npedagogy and assessment that unintentionally harm students.\\nTo address this concern, researchers and practitioners could\\nco-design solutions with students. Co-design is useful for cur-\\nriculum design [49] and has already been used for integrating\\nAI into classrooms [50]. These techniques may not only result\\nin better, more equitable solutions but also have the potential\\nto build relationships and leverage students’ deeper familiarity\\nwith these GAI tools.\\nC. Conclusion\\nThis paper presents the first systematic investigation of both\\nstudents’ and instructors’ experiences with and preferences\\nfor using GAI tools in computing classrooms. While these\\nresults are preliminary, we believe that rapidly disseminating\\nthese critical views can guide researchers to capitalize on\\nopportunities while mitigating potential challenges.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nWe would like to thank Dr. Brian McInnis for feedback on\\nthe abstract which helped refine the final framing of the paper.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] S.

       " 'Markov Chains\\nIntroduction\\nMarkov chains and Monte Carlo Markov chains are mathematical processes that are based on probability and are commonly used in statistics. A Markov chain is a random process that moves from one state to another, with the next state depending only on the current state - hence it has the Markov \"memoryless\" property. A simple example is modeling a sequence of days with sunny or rainy weather, where the weather on a given day is randomly determined based solely on the weather of the previous day. Monte Carlo Markov chains are a class of algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, leveraging the Markov chain framework to model systems like weather, stock prices, or molecular interactions. A key application is statistical inference - using Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov process to estimate properties of complex distributions and models that cannot be easily analyzed directly. Overall, Markov chains provide a mathematical framework to model random processes over time, while Monte Carlo Markov chains use this to build simulation models for generating sample data from probability distributions of interest across many areas of science, finance, and machine learning.\\nFormulating Markov Chains Mathematically\\nAt its core, a Markov chain comprises a discrete set of states and transition probabilities between each pair of states. This is commonly represented as a state transition matrix , where each element  denotes the probability of moving from state  to state  on a given step. The current state combined with  fully parametrizes the next state - encapsulating the memoryless Markov property. Mathematically, if  is a random variable representing the system state at time , then \\n\\n This formula signifies the conditional distribution of future states depends only on the current state. Based on P, foundational Markov chain analysis provides equilibria, stationary distributions, ergodic behaviors, and other statistical properties. Algorithms like Monte Carlo methods can also simulate trajectories of Markov processes by randomly hopping states guided by the transition probabilities. This pure probabilistic approach enables modeling phenomena from physics, biology, and beyond for theoretical and practical insights. \\n\\nText Generation through Markov Processes\\nText generation can be formulated as a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for Markov decision processes (MDPs). The Markov property - where the current state encapsulates necessary context - allows generating text word-by-word based on preceding terms. This establishes a lightweight, yet versatile approach compared to heavy parameterization with neural networks.\\nConsider a Markov chain text model that gives higher rewards for coherent sentences conforming to grammar and lower rewards otherwise. By optimizing cumulative future reward, the model learns probable transitions between words reflecting sensible narratives. Such statistical text generation circumvents manual rule-encoding.\\nFor example, initializing the state with \"Alice was\" and sampling subsequent actions as words yield:\\n\"Alice was heading to the store when...\"\\n\"Alice was shocked to discover that...\"\\n\"Alice was running late for her appointment...\"\\nThe model associates those sentences starting with the phrase \"Alice was\" which commonly transitions towards other verbs or plot-advancing events.\\nMarkov decision processes apply such iterative reward feedback grounded in state transitions to optimize text generation policies. Their efficient yet effective learning drives adoptions in chatbots for dialog modeling or summarization systems for extracting key points - producing sensible language output without laborious feature engineering. By rewarding linguistic coherency, Markovian reinforcement learning promises to advance automated and creative text generation. \\nMonte Carlo Method\\nThe Monte Carlo method refers to a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The basic concept is to use probability statistics computed from simulations using random number sequences to estimate properties of some process or model. A very simple example is estimating  - we could generate random (x,y) points on a square enclosed in a circle and count what fraction falls inside the circle to estimate its area relative to the square. As the number of samples increases, the estimate converges to , based on area geometry. In computer science, Monte Carlo methods are commonly used for risk analysis, optimization, inference, and machine learning. Common applications include pathfinding, decision tree learning, and evaluating multidimensional integrals in physics simulations that are too complex to solve analytically. The algorithms are useful since they are often easier to implement than deriving explicit solutions while providing great flexibility. With advances in computational power, Monte Carlo is a versatile, parallelizable, and ever-growing approach for practical stochastic modeling and estimation.\\nMonte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC)\\nA Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) combines Markov chain sampling with Monte Carlo simulation for efficient numerical analysis and statistical estimation. The key advantage of a Markov chain process is that future states depend only on the current state - no historical trajectory is required. This memoryless property allows hopping to completely new states based solely on transition probabilities. When combined with random sampling over many independent iterations in the Monte Carlo framework, MCMC allows efficient exploring and learning of the properties of extremely complex high-dimensional probability distributions, used widely from computational physics to modern machine learning. The states traversed form a Markov chain, while the randomness injected through Monte Carlo testing enables broader coverage for improved generalizability. Together they provide a versatile yet lightweight framework to model real-world stochastic processes like financial trends, genome sequencing, and social networks. The Markov assumption reduces complexity for model learning, while simulation-based inference maps complex spaces difficult to be studied analytically. Their synergy thereby expands the scope and scalability for statistical analysis.\\nMCMC in layman\\'s terms\\nMCMC is like playing a board game to explore new places. Imagine you are playing Snakes and Ladders. Your piece starts at the beginning. Where you land next depends only on your current spot - if you land at the bottom of a ladder, you climb up and advance faster! This is like a Markov Chain, where you hop directly between connected spots based on set rules.\\nNow let us add dice rolling like in Monopoly. On each turn, you advance a random number of steps based on the rolled dice value. This randomness helps you explore more spots, not only the connected ones. Even far-away spots now have a chance of being visited through random big dice rolls combined with climbing ladders. This way you get to know the board better compared to moving along just adjacent squares!\\nMCMC stats methods do the same - randomized Monte Carlo dice rolls are combined with Markov Chain ladder climbs to solve problems. It allows studying huge complex game boards by directly hopping between interesting features through many simulated traversals, something too long by standard play. The random dice rolls ensure you experience more possibilities to learn the rules better!\\nIn summary, MCMC combines targeted but stable Markov Chain exploration with excited dashing about via Monte Carlo randomness - letting you understand big new worlds faster.\\nMCMC in Robots\\nMonte Carlo Markov chains demonstrate great utility for reinforcement learning algorithms seeking to maximize cumulative rewards by interacting with complex environments. Consider training a robot to navigate obstacle courses. The state space encoding positions and sensor data are enormous - far too large to explore exhaustively in a reasonable time. Instead, a Markov chain model is created to hop between proximate states based on a learned policy, avoiding obstacles while progressing toward goal locations that yield rewards. By incorporating randomness to regularly sample exploratory actions during training, the Monte Carlo aspect ensures better coverage for improved policy learning. The robot simulates experience by traversing the Markov chain policy, integrating rewards over time to refine decisions. After sufficient simulation iterations, high-reward state-action sequences are discovered without prohibitively expensive physical trial-and-error. The emergency policy maps large state spaces to productive actions. Blending temporary memoryless state transitions with randomized jumps thus makes Monte Carlo Markov methods exceptionally suitable for reinforcement learning problems.\\n\\n']"

In the computing educationcontext, these models are being used to generate code, codeexplanations, and programming exercises. The rapid adoptionof these models has prompted multiple position papers andworkshops which discuss the implications of these models forcomputing education, both positive and negative. This paperpresents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with12 students and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences,and preferences regarding the use of tools powered by generativeAI in computing classrooms. The results suggest that GenerativeAI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant role incomputing education. However, students and instructors alsoraised numerous concerns about how these models should beintegrated to best support the needs and learning goals ofstudents. We also identified interesting tensions and alignmentsthat emerged between how instructors and students prefer toengage with these models. As GAI tools become in-creasingly prevalent, it’s important to understand educationalstakeholders’ preferences and values to ensure that these toolscan be used for good and that potential harms can be mitigated. Index Terms —Generative models, large language models, com-puting education, student perceptions, instructor perceptionsI. I NTRODUCTION The introduction of Generative AI (GAI) models has ledto significant excitement in the computing education com-munity [1]–[10]. These generative models are typically pow-ered by large language models such as GPT-3 or Codexwhich are capable of producing code explanations [5], [6],[9] that have been rated as being better than peer-generatedexplanations [9]. In addition, these models can solve basicprogramming assignments [1], [7] and perform slightly worsethan students on quizzes with multiple-choice questions [8]. Understandably, these substantial and rapid advances in theperformance of generative models are causing excitementand consternation among students and instructors. A recentbirds of a feather discussion at the SIGCSE conference [11]highlighted a few emerging concerns that educators haverelated to over-reliance, plagiarism, and other forms of misuse. These concerns have been echoed by position papers [7], [12],a working group [13], and an investigation into instructorperspectives [14]. However, these concerns only scratch thesurface, there is an urgent need to understand students’ andinstructors’ preferences about and what they want from theseGAI tools so that future development and regulation can alignwith the values of these critical stakeholders. In this paper, we conduct an interview study with 18participants including both students (N=12) and instructors(N=6). The goal of this interview study is to better understandthese two key stakeholders’ awareness of these models andtheir preferences about how these models should be usedin computing education classrooms. terested in what ways students and instructors envision theinvolvement of generative AI in computing education, bothpositively and negatively. In this paper, we investigate three research questions:RQ1 : What preferences do instructors and students haveregarding how Generative AI should be used in comput-ing education classes? RQ2 : What concerns do instructors and students have re-garding the use of Generative AI in computing education? What implications might Generative AI have oncomputing education curricula, pedagogy, and assessmentmethods? The results from our study suggest that students and in- structors believe computing course curricula and assessmentmethods should be updated to include GAI tools; however,there are important challenges which need to be addressed inorder to use them successfully while reducing their potentialharm to instructors and students alike. These results providearXiv:2308.04309v1  [cs.HC]  8 Aug 2023a timely and important snapshot of students’ and instructors’perspectives and preferences which can inform the design ofpedagogies, tools, and policies that best align with students’preferences and needs. R ELATED WORKA. An AI Phase-Shift in the ClassroomLess than three decades ago, widespread access to theInternet fundamentally changed the education landscape. Asinternet access in the United States rose from 14 to 77 percent,students could suddenly access educational resources, playeducational games, and interact with peers in online learningcommunities. This inequitable access to these resources alsoled to a digital divide where some students were left behindbecause they did not have personal computers or reliableinternet access [15]. Recent advances in AI are poised to createa similar phase shift in the education landscape. AI-poweredtools are becoming ubiquitous both in online and face-to-facelearning environments. From a student’s perspective, these AI-powered tools provide a number of important benefits suchas an increased awareness of their performance, personalizedlearning pathways [16], and personalized support in the formof intelligent tutors [17], [18]. From an instructor’s perspec-tive, learning analytics tools provide instructors with the abilityto monitor student activity and adapt their teaching [19]–[22]. Some of these tools are even integrated into classroomenvironments where instructors can use augmented reality tomonitor student learning, metacognition, and behavior in real-time [23]. discuss additional ways in which AIin the classroom can be beneficial for instructors such asin improving student reviews, grading, and feedback, utiliz-ing intelligent tutoring systems, and improving pedagogicalpractices and student experiences using AI-powered VR forexperiential or practical learning experiences [24]. However, many of these advances have been limited bythe current abilities of machine learning. Recent advances inmachine learning have introduced generative models capableof understanding and generating code have crucial implicationsfor computing education. Researchers are already demonstrat-ing the capabilities of these models to help students generatecode [3], [25], [26], explain code to students [5], [6], However,there are also some emerging challenges related to over-reliance and plagiarism [5], [11]. For instance, a recent studyshowed how these models can perform nearly as well asstudents on multiple-choice questions [8]. Considering the Design of AI Systems The introduction of AI systems has led to new designchallenges related to their probabilistic nature, their lack oftransparency, and their issues related to fairness and These challenges have led to rapidly evolving researchtopics such as explainable AI (XAI), human-AI interaction(HAII), and human-centered machine learning. Across these fields,there is a resounding call to focus on approaches that arehuman-centered [27]. Additionally, people calibrate their trust through interactionsand experiences with the AI system [29]; however, otherfactors such as age, culture, and personality can also affecttrust in AI systems [30]. Numerous computing education researchers are already ad-dressing these issues of explainability, trust, and over-reliance. Their framework outlined 6 importantfactors to consider when building XAI: who the stakeholdersare (e.g., instructors and students), what benefits stakeholdersreceive from interacting with the system, what potential issuesstakeholders may encounter when using the system, howexplanations are presented, what AI models are used, and thebest ways to design user-friendly and effective AIED systems. However, the usage of GAI tools in education, suchas ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, poses a unique problem, asthey were not developed solely for an educational purpose andtheir inclusion in the classroom may have unknown effects. Many researchers have begun to explore the potential negativeeffects the inclusion of these models into education may bring,including bias and fairness of these models, over-reliance,explainability, and trust [7], [11]. M ETHODOLOGYTo investigate our research questions about student and in- The field ofcomputing education has begun adopting interview studies[36]–[39], often to explore the perspectives of instructorsor students with respect to topics such as instructor painpoints [40] or student perspectives about online versus on-site teaching [41]. In this study, we focus on the perspectivesof both instructors and students because it is critical to includeall relevant stakeholders when considering the implications ofnew technology such as generative AI.A. Participant DemographicsWe conducted interviews with students (N=12) and instruc-tors (N=6) which resulted in 18 total interviews. Theinstructors included a mix of tenure-track and teaching-trackfaculty. Students were recruited through student organizations,flyers, and snowball sampling. All of the instructors interviewed taughtcomputer science courses. Two researchers followed thisprocess independently, then compared codes in order to helpmitigate interpretation biases. There is currently an urgent need to understand the im-plications of generative AI in computing education. For ex-ample, researchers and practitioners are already raising con-cerns about over-reliance, academic misconduct, and modeltrustworthiness This work serves as an early probeinto understanding current preferences, values, and concerns. While limited in scope, our work provides a preliminaryinvestigation in order to help instructors, researchers, and morequickly adapt to this changing landscape. The participants ofthis study, both instructors and students, came from a singleR1 university and represent a relatively small sample size,and as such, these results may not fully represent differentdemographics across different universities. R ESULTS - THEMES FROM STUDENT INTERVIEWS In this section, we present the themes that emerged from ourstudent interviews. A summarized version of the results frominterviews with both stakeholders (students and instructors)can be found in Figure 1.Within each theme, we present sub-themes, our observations, relevant supporting quotes, and rela- tionships between the theme and our three research questionspresented in the introduction. Despite focusing our questionson Generative AI (GAI) tools such as GitHub Copilot, Codex,and Grammarly, our participants tended to focus on ChatGPT. A. Perceived Benefits of GAI Tools (RQ1)Students shared the ways in which they have found GAITools to be beneficial in their computing courses, as well astheir potential uses in computing education. GAI tools reduce the effort to write code and findlearning materials. Most students (10/12) believed that GAItools, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to become, andin many cases are already, valuable learning tools to reducethe effort for students and instructors to complete somecommon programming tasks and find learning materials. Ofthe remaining two students, one was not very familiar withGAI tools and was therefore unsure of their value and theother actively tried to avoid using them. Students shared a number of ways in which they have foundGAI tools useful in the computing education context:•Generating skeleton or boilerplate code (S2, S3, S8, S9) •Generating explanations of code (S2, S6, S7, S10, S11) Reflecting on how GAI tools can generate examples to sup-plement existing learning materials, S2 said,“[Students] can use [ChatGPT] to find resourcesonline... Students use GAI tools to avoid busy work. When askedwhat motivates students to use these tools, students who fre-quently use them expressed that they were more likely to useGAI tools for assisting with, or even completing, assignmentsthat they perceived as “meaningless” or mere “busy work.” Some students (4/12) compared it to existing tools, such asthe calculator, whose introduction into the classroom allowedstudents to progress towards more advanced topics faster andreduce the amount of time students have to spend on familiartasks or could be considered tedious [46]. According to someof the students, this refers to any work that takes too much oftheir time for very little academic benefit or that they aren’tpassionate about. Participant S2 remarked on what kind ofwork they use ChatGPT for the most, saying,“ChatGPT could just kind of do all the busy workor anything I could figure out, in like a couple ofminutes. GAI tools shift the focus to higher levels of abstraction. Students expressed (6/12) that GAI tools could help reduce theamount of time spent working at lower levels of abstraction. Students often gave examples of how GAI tools could shift thelearner’s focus toward higher-level skills (e.g., design, the anal-ysis and evaluation of code, or advanced software engineeringconcepts) which students are more likely to encounter in latercomputing courses. For example, participant S9 described howstudents might focus on design patterns and software designrather than implementation details. On the left, summarized themes from student interviews are presented and, on the right, summarized themes from instructor interviews are presented. “You don’t usually get design patterns until you arein graduate school, right? Unless you’d specificallyseek it out...we could use ChatGPT to help teachdesign patterns where... You can use ChatGPT as atool to implement all the little pieces. But we aregoing to try to break down this larger problem tofigure out what pattern applies to it, and then usewhatever you need to use to generate the individualpieces of code. But we really care about the overallstructure and making sure that the students kindof have this broader understanding of the piece ofsoftware rather than a single algorithm or a singlepiece of code or a smaller scale program. ” GAI tools provide alternative perspectives and sourcesof assistance. Another common theme amongst students whoregularly use GAI tools is that these tools provide anothersource of assistance outside and their instructors and teachingassistants (4/12). Some reasons why students said they chooseto use a tool such as ChatGPT rather than asking theirinstructors or teaching assistants are:•Some professors are not good at explaining course con-cepts and code (S4, S5)•GAI tools can provide multiple and alternative perspec-tives about programming concepts (S5, S10) •GAI tools can be more convenient sources of assistanceover instructors or TAs (S5, S8) S4 described a time in which they wished they were able touse GAI tools in order to get more help with a concept inone of their computing courses, especially when they foundthemselves searching for a different perspective when they felttheir instructor wasn’t communicating what they needed,“With some professors, they don’t know how tocommunicate the answer that you’re looking for...I had a lot of trouble wrapping my head around itwhen I asked in what context will we use a linkedlist. [My Instructor] just explained what a linkedlist was, and with ChatGPT, I feel like I could say,‘give me an example of a linked list and how I wouldimplement it in this language, ’ ” B. Concerns about GAI Tools (RQ2) While students largely expressed excitement about GAItools’ benefits to computing education , students also expressedan amount of trepidation and concern regarding their use incomputing education. Concerns about over-reliance. Most students (9/12) men-tioned the potential for students to develop an over-relianceon these tools as a concern. More specifically, students (6/12)detailed their concerns about the quality of education studentsreceive if they become over-reliant on GAI tools that don’tadequately explain their responses. Some of the specific con-cerns about over-reliance and the quality of education were:•Students may not develop an understanding of the ma-terial when they get assistance from GAI tools (S1, S4,S5, S9, S11, S12) The following quotes from participants further illustrate someof these student concerns. Participant S1 said,“When using them I don’t really fully understandwhat they’re telling me, and it’s just kind of like,‘Oh! But I’m not really the onelearning and really digesting what’s happening andhow I got to that conclusion. ” Participant S4 provided an additional perspective, saying,“I feel like a lot of people just heavily rely on it, andthey use it to just copy and paste the work, and notnecessarily understand why. I feel like they wouldjust copy the work given to them. It kind of ruinsthe purpose of learning it in the first place. ” Concerns about trustworthiness. The majority of students(7/12) also expressed concerns about the trustworthiness ofthe output given by GAI tools. Students raised concerns aboutthe reliability of information generated by these models dueto their potential to misinform students. Specifically, studentsoutlined the following concerns about trustworthiness:•Information sources are missing or incorrect (S1, S8, S9) •GAI tools tend to hallucinate information (S6, S8, S10)•Students have to double-check everything, not just infor-mation, but things like false context and tone (S4, S6)Participant S8 said, due to these models’ tendency to hal-lucinate students have to be careful to double-check theinformation they receive,“[ChatGPT] is helpful, but I understand that some-times it also hallucinates as well. I don’t really know if it is yetlike a Google replacement..., I feel like it’s only asuseful if you really know the topic that you’re talkingabout, and like you can read what it’s saying, and besure that it’s not like [meaningless output], becausesometimes you do have to search again on Googlejust to make sure what it said is correct. ” Participant S4 also described needing to check responses forcorrectness, sharing that it wouldn’t stop them from using GAItools altogether and it prevents them from relying on the toolstoo much,“[Incorrect ChatGPT responses] wouldn’t keep mefrom using it again. It’s just a small detail. Concerns about academic integrity. These students expressed the belief that the amount of plagia-rism will increase as these tools become more popular. However, students did not necessarily believe that AI-aidedplagiarism is all that different from plagiarism that occurredpreviously. Students claimed that the only difference betweenplagiarizing by copying someone else’s work or paying fora subscription service such as Chegg and using a tool likeChatGPT is that it’s free and available to everyone. “Before I’ve seen people use things like, Chegg, tojust straight up just finish their homework. I feel likeit’s just a difference between you using ChatGPT,which is a free service, and it can give you theinformation you want, and you could probably justchange up a couple of things with it versus payinga fee for a subscription-based service that just hoststhe work that your professors are giving to you. ” (S4)C. Predicted Implications of GAI Tools (RQ3) Students were excited to share their insight about howcourse curricula and assessment methodologies should beadapted to accommodate GAI tools. Instructors are responsible for adapting their courses. Inour interviews, none of the students said that instructors shouldban the use of GAI tools. On the contrary, multiple students(5/12) expressed that instructors are responsible for adaptingtheir courses in ways to work with this new technology, asinstructors have had to in the past with any innovative andpopular technology, such as calculators, Wikipedia, and theInternet (4/12). While the majority of students expressed thatthey were not sure exactly what steps need to be taken byinstructors in order to adapt their classes, a couple of studentsindicated updates they hope instructors do notmake to theirclasses. However,both students said they would not want this,“I guess they would have to possibly lower labweights and maybe increase exam weights, or youknow things that can be more so tested in person... Ifeel like it shouldn’t be like that... I kind of had thebenefit of, like, you know, being able to use Google,having like a 40-50% like lab weight. Being able touse Google, learn, read a lot of documentation, andyou know, actually, kind of somewhat suffer throughlabs, but also I knew that the lab grade would saveme because I wasn’t as good on exams, ” (S8) Instructors must focus on student engagement. Severalstudents (3/12) specifically mentioned that, when learning newmaterial, hands-on active-learning assignments are the mosthelpful and engaging. Students (4/12) emphasized that theybelieved that engaging courses and coursework would morelikely result in engaged students who see value in and wantto complete the assignments and are less likely to plagiarize. Participant S1 said the following,“Instructors need to understand why students useChatGPT in the first place, and some of the reasonswhy they use it is they just don’t understand thecontent, and they want an easy out and that meansthat something is going wrong with the curriculumthat’s being presented to them. ” Instructors should incorporate GAI tools into the classes. Students were excited about the potential for instructors toinclude these models in their curricula. Students suggestedthat instructors could focus less on implementation detailsand more on high-level concepts. Participant S5 pointed tothe importance of other skills that should be learned in earlyprogramming courses, particularly problem-solving. “I think learning the language is the easiest part, but I think the introductory programming coursesoffer something a little bit more important, which isproblem-solving. Which I think will still ... be a veryimportant part of programming, because that’s reallyall programming is. It’s just problem-solving... Butthe problem-solving mindset is definitely somethingthat cannot just be assumed people have. ” Students (4/12) also suggested that instructors could teachstudents how to use GAI tools by teaching students the bestways to prompt tools such as ChatGPT and the limitationsand risks of using these tools. A couple of students alsosuggested instructors could use GAI tools to scaffold learning,as described in more detail by participant S5,“It’s like asking a mathematician to do mundanerepetitive math equations today without a calcula-tor... Notreally. So, I think instructors should, you know, startoff teaching their students, you know, how to do it. How to do everything without an AI language modelto help them. And then, as they get more advancedwith it, they, you know, introduce the AI to just, youknow, make the more difficult tasks a bit easier. ” The following section details the themes and observationsdiscovered through our instructor interviews. Similar to stu-dents, instructors tended to focus primarily on ChatGPT. A. Perceived Benefits of GAI Tools (RQ1) While instructors (5/6) have not used GAI tools frequently,they envision a number of ways in which they can be beneficialfor students in computing courses. Overall, instructors werefamiliar with GAI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot,but used them much less than students. Consequently, theyhad fewer insights about they might be used in the computingeducation context. However, every instructor (6/6) thought thatthese tools could be valuable for students. GAI tools can help students understand code and com-puting concepts. A couple of instructors (2/6) thought thatGAI tools were beneficial for students when they encounterunfamiliar code and that GAI tools could provide just-in-timesupport. While prior work has demonstrated the ability ofgenerative AI to explain code, participant I2 described how thishelps students when they encounter unfamiliar code online,“You can give [ChatGPT] a little piece of a programyou got from Github or whatever, and have it explainto you what this code is doing, and it would do agood job. ” GAI tools can help students find inspiration, brainstorm,and get feedback on ideas. A majority of the instructors(4/6) detailed ways in which GAI tools could be used to aidin creative processes such as ideation and brainstorming. Forexample, participant I1 described how GAI tools can helpwith brainstorming solutions to coding problems. Additionally,some instructors (2/6) described ways in which they’ve foundsuccess in having GAI tools, specifically ChatGPT, providestudents with feedback on their writing for project-basedcomputing courses. Participant I2 described how they’ve hadstudents use ChatGPT to try to find weaknesses or areas ofimprovement for their essays or project proposals. GAI tools’ low cost and accessibility can provide stu-dents with high quality learning resources. A couple ofinstructors (2/6) expressed their excitement about how the lowcost and barrier to entry can provide students with resourcesthat can be prohibitively expensive, such as private tutors orpaid services such as Chegg or CourseHero. Additionally, GAItools could act as high quality learning resources outside ofstudents’ instructors and TAs, providing another perspectiveon course topics. B. Concerns about GAI Tools (RQ2)Instructors hold many common concerns regarding AI sys-tems for the use of generative AI in computing education andtheir use by students. Concerns about trustworthiness. Most of the instructors(5/6) cited the lack of trustworthiness of responses from GAItools as one of their primary concerns. All of the instructorsmentioned that it’s important to double-check the informa-tion received from these models. However, as one instructorpointed out, students don’t always have the necessary foun-dational knowledge to know whether the outputs are right orwrong. Participant I4 said,“We don’t know that [ChatGPT] is giving [students]the right information. and you know, if I know atopic, I know when I’m getting bogus information. They don’t, you know, so that’s a concern. ” Concerns about over-reliance. Several instructors (3/6)also cited over-reliance as a significant concern when consid-ering students using these models in their classes. ParticipantI3 expressed concern about students not fully learning materialif they rely too heavily on GAI tools. Participants I1 andI3 both expressed concern that students may lose importantskills, such as writing, if they become too reliant on thesemodels. Participant I5 discussed their concern about GAI toolsreplacing students’ own effort, saying,“I think pedagogically, we’ll have to kind of go backto the drawing board. Not necessarily just to prevent studentsfrom using and benefiting from these tools, by allmeans we should embrace change and new methodsand new ways of doing things. So find ways wherestudents can use these things to assist, to help butnot one where it replaces their own cognitive load. ” Concerns about academic integrity. All instructors (6/6) ex- pressed concern about students using GAI tools to plagiarize. Several instructors (4/6) expressed that, due to the availabilityand low cost of tools like ChatGPT, students are likely toplagiarize more. However, one instructor (I5) said,“I feel like a student who was never motivatedto cheat in the first place will not do it now justbecause ChatGPT is available. Sufficiently motivatedstudents would have always cheated. So if I were tolazily assume that there is an uptick in the numberof students who are now exploiting this tool oran uptick in the number of students who are nowcheating as a result of this tool, it would havebeen those in the middle who were always willingto, but perhaps lack the time, resources, access,or the know-how to properly engage in it, but Idon’t think just there’s this giant movement towardsmore students doing it, who would not have doneit otherwise. I don’t think it’s turning students intocheaters. I think it’s just making it more accessibleto those who already would have done it. ” This participant’s insight aligns with the perspectives sharedby the other instructors in that, the concerns about academicintegrity which have arisen due to the presence of GAI tools inthe classroom, are less focused on just stopping students fromcheating, which is unlikely, but rather in developing ways inwhich instructors can disincentivize cheating. C. Predicted Implications of GAI Tools (RQ3)Instructors shared uncertainty about what exactly needs tochange in course designs and assessment methods; however,they emphasized the importance of proactively incorporatingthese models into computing education curricula. GAI tools should be incorporated into classrooms. Unanimously, instructors (6/6) emphasized that they believeGAI tools should not be banned, and they should embracetheir existence and include them in the classroom. Instructorsbelieved it was imperative to understand how these tools work. Some of the ways they envisioned incorporating GAI tools intotheir courses included:•Let students use it but they should be able to explain whythe output is correct or incorrect (I1, I3, I6)•Clearly articulate what students need to know how to dowithout using GAI tools (I4)Participant I4, detailed how, with any new tools which shifthow courses are taught, clear expectations for students needto be established,“... before calculators were a thing we used to expectstudents to memorize multiplication and divisiontables. And you know, after the calculator cameinto being, of course, you know it’s reasonable notto expect people to memorize that when you knowthey’ve got a tool that they can use to figure outhow to multiply things, you know. And I could seethe same thing happening with us with programmingnow that tools like ChatGPT exist, you know, maybethere are certain things that we could expect studentsto use a tool for, and we don’t have to test them onit. But at the same time, you know, there has to besome core level of knowledge that we should expectfrom a student, you know, without the use of tools. ” GAI tools can facilitate critical thinking A couple ofinstructors (2/6) were excited about the potential to use thesemodels in their courses to help students further develop theircritical thinking and analysis skills. Participant I6 said,“ Let them actually use ChatGPT to come back witha report as a first draft. So in that sense, it is more useful for thestudent to develop their critical thinking... instead ofjust like the old way of just writing a report. ” It’snot, give me code, it’s, here is some code, give mesome sort of analysis that matches or fits into some-thing that is not easily template-tized, something thatis not easily described or describable. ” Instructors need to update assessment methods. In termsof how to update curriculum to adapt courses to account forthe existence of these models, instructors did not have a veryclear idea of what exactly needed to be done, with manyexpressing uncertainty about the best way to assess studentprogress, prevent plagiarism, and ensure that students do notrely too heavily on the models, hindering their education. Intheir interviews, instructors did mention a few considerationsthey had for updating their assessment methods:•Mitigate plagiarism by developing engaging assignmentsand reducing busy work (I3)•Change course grade weights such that easily plagiarizedassignments can’t carry students’ grades (I4, I5) D ISCUSSION & C ONCLUSIONA. Converging Themes across Stakeholders and Opportunities In this section, we present converging themes that emergedthrough our stakeholder interviews. Based on these areas ofconvergence, we present some opportunities to maximize thebenefits of generative models in computing education settings. 1) Students and instructors are concerned about trustwor-thiness and over-reliance: Across most interviews, studentsand instructors were concerned about the trustworthiness ofGAI tools as well as the potential for students to become over-reliant on them. Participants highlighted the black-box natureof GAI and their tendency to hallucinate non-factual informa-tion. This raised concerns about students not understandingthe responses they receive from GAI, a lack of reliability ofthe information received, and the impact of over-reliance onstudents’ learning outcomes. Opportunity #1: Explicitly teach students when and how touse GAI tools. Educators can teach courses and modules abouthow to fact-check the model’s output in cases where the modelis known to perform poorly; calibrating a healthy skepticismin generative AI. Additionally, instructors should not assumecomputing students have AI literacy. It may be necessary toteach courses in computational thinking and AI literacy [47]. 2) Students and instructors believe GAI tools will broadenaccess: Students expressed that they believed tools like Chat-GPT are valuable learning tools, partially due to the fact thatit’s available at any time and it’s free or inexpensive to use. Opportunity #2: GAI tools democratize access to help. Similarto when unequal access to the Internet caused some students tobe left behind [15], today, unequal financial access to tutors,unpaid internships, college prep programs, and paid contentcan have similar effects. GAI tools may offer cheaper accessto high-quality tutoring. B. Diverging Themes across Stakeholders and Challenges In this section, we present some diverging themes whichhave the potential to cause tension between students andinstructors. We also describe how these divergences in prefer-ences may eventually lead to challenges. 1) Students tended to be more familiar and frequent usersof GAI tools than instructors: The majority of the studentswere either familiar with the capabilities of GAI tools or usethem frequently. On the contrary, some instructors had triedGAI tools, but they did not use them very frequently. Challenge #1: Instructors need to become familiar withthe functionality and limitations of GAI tools in order toadapt curricula and assessment methods adequately. Currently,instructors are at a disadvantage to students who are muchmore familiar with these models. 2) Students and instructors are not aligned on how to adaptassessment: While both stakeholders expressed uncertaintyabout how to adapt assessment methods to account for GAItools, the suggestions they did provide did not align. Studentsemphasized that the weight and frequency of hands-on, activelearning assignments, such as programming labs, should notchange as they are valuable to students’ comprehension of newmaterial and learning goals. A few of the instructors proposedto adapt their assessment methods to combat academic dishon-esty by reducing the weight of some of the lab assignmentsand increasing the weight or frequency of in-class, proctoredassignments, such as quizzes or tests. This divergence betweenthe values of students and instructors has the potential to createsignificant tension between students and instructors. Challenge #2: Instructors wanted to develop assessmentsthat mitigate academic dishonesty. One-third of interviewedinstructors suggested doing this by increasing the weightof proctored exams. However, students expressed that theystill want hands-on and active learning assignments (e.g.,programming lab assignments) to represent a larger portionof their overall grade, because, as many students expressed,they learned better when they were engaged in the tasks theyhad to complete. Increasing the frequency or weight of in-class proctored exams moves away from evidence-based activelearning [48], additionally it may negatively affect students. 3) Instructors were not aware of students’ motivations forusing GAI tools: Students shared a variety of reasons as towhy they would choose to use GAI tools to assist with or com-plete their assignments, such as reducing busy work, gettinganother perspective other than their instructor on a concept,and getting help when their instructor is not available. Wheninstructors were asked to consider why students use thesemodels, the only common response was regarding studentsusing GAI tools for busy work. Challenge #3: Instructors need to better understand stu-dents’ motivations for using GAI tools. Without this un-derstanding, instructors could potentially make changes topedagogy and assessment that unintentionally harm students. To address this concern, researchers and practitioners couldco-design solutions with students. Co-design is useful for cur-riculum design [49] and has already been used for integratingAI into classrooms [50]. These techniques may not only resultin better, more equitable solutions but also have the potentialto build relationships and leverage students’ deeper familiaritywith these GAI tools. C. ConclusionThis paper presents the first systematic investigation of bothstudents’ and instructors’ experiences with and preferencesfor using GAI tools in computing classrooms. While theseresults are preliminary, we believe that rapidly disseminatingthese critical views can guide researchers to capitalize onopportunities while mitigating potential challenges.

Carefully account-ability. They havealso led to the creation of new conferences that focus onfairness, accountability, and transparency. For instance, XAI has grappled withquestions like explainable to who and for what purpose [28].

This qualitative research method is oftenused to elicit participants’ perceptions, experiences, and valuesregarding a particular topic or technology [35].

FRANK BAUM  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration]  DEDICATED TO HARRIET A. B. NEAL. The children won\\'t let me stop telling talesof the Land of Oz. I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tellthem, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won\\'t allowme. They cry: \"Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" After the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothyhas become a firm fixture in these Oz stories. The little ones all loveDorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn\\'t a realOz story without her.\" So here she is again, as sweet and gentle andinnocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange adventure. There were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more aboutthe Wizard.\" It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in thefirst Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself\"a humbug.\" The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in aballoon and they were all waiting for him to come down again. So whatcould I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"? You willfind him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before. There was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible todo in this present book: they bade me introduce Toto, Dorothy\\'s littleblack dog, who has many friends among my readers. But you will see, whenyou begin to read the story, that Toto was in Kansas while Dorothy wasin California, and so she had to start on her adventure without him. Inthis book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog;but in the next Oz book, if I am permitted to write one, I intend totell a good deal about Toto\\'s further history. Princess Ozma, whom I love as much as my readers do, is again introducedin this story, and so are several of our old friends of Oz. You willalso become acquainted with Jim the Cab-Horse, the Nine Tiny Piglets,and Eureka, the Kitten. I am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved asshe ought to have been; but perhaps she wasn\\'t brought up properly. Dorothy found her, you see, and who her parents were nobody knows. Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while Iread the tender, loving, appealing letters that come to me in almostevery mail from my little readers. I try to answer every letter of my young correspondents; yet sometimesthere are so many letters that a little time must pass before you getyour answer. But be patient, friends, for the answer will surely come,and by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task ofpreparing these books. Besides, I am proud to acknowledge that the booksare partly yours, for your suggestions often guide me in telling thestories, and I am sure they would not be half so good without yourclever and thoughtful assistance.

As it came to a stop theconductor called out in a loud voice:\"Hugson\\'s Siding!\"At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of thecar, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cagecovered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tuckedunder her arm. The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappearedaround a curve; then she turned to see where she was. The shed at Hugson\\'s Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, anddid not look very inviting. As she peered through the soft gray lightnot a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any personin sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggystanding near a group of trees a short distance away. She walked towardit and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with itshead hanging down almost to the ground. It was a big horse, tall andbony, with long legs and large knees and feet. Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw aboy curled up on the seat, fast asleep. She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. he said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"\"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinkinggray eyes. \"Have you come to take me to Hugson\\'s Ranch? \"\"Of course,\" he answered. \"Train in?\"\"I couldn\\'t be here if it wasn\\'t,\" she said. He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping out ofthe buggy he put Dorothy\\'s suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage onthe floor in front. \"Canary-birds?\" he asked. \"Oh, no; it\\'s just Eureka, my kitten. I thought that was the best way tocarry her. \"The boy nodded. \"Eureka\\'s a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked. \"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained. \"Uncle Henrysays \\'Eureka\\' means \\'I have found it.\\' \"\"All right; hop in. Then the boy picked upthe reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\" The horse did not stir. Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of hisdrooping ears, but that was all. \"Gid-dap!\" called the boy, again. The horse stood still. \"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go. \"The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out. \"Guess I\\'m half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse. Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse atonce backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trotdown the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light. \"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy. \"I\\'ve waited atthat station for five hours. \"\"We had a lot of earthquakes,\" said Dorothy. \"Didn\\'t you feel the groundshake?\"\"Yes; but we\\'re used to such things in California,\" he replied. \"Theydon\\'t scare us much. \"[Illustration: DOROTHY POKED THE BOY WITH HER PARASOL.]\"The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew. \"\"Did he? Then it must have happened while I was asleep,\" he said,thoughtfully. \"How is Uncle Henry?\" she enquired, after a pause during which the horsecontinued to trot with long, regular strides. \"He\\'s pretty well. He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit. \"\"Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?\" she asked. \"Yes. Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry\\'s wife\\'s sister; so wemust be second cousins,\" said the boy, in an amused tone. \"I work forUncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and myboard. \"\"Isn\\'t that a great deal?\" she asked, doubtfully. \"Why, it\\'s a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me. I\\'m a splendidworker. I work as well as I sleep,\" he added, with a laugh. \"What is your name?\" asked Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy\\'s mannerand the cheery tone of his voice. \"Not a very pretty one,\" he answered, as if a little ashamed. \"My wholename is Zebediah; but folks just call me \\'Zeb.\\' You\\'ve been toAustralia, haven\\'t you? \"\"Yes; with Uncle Henry,\" she answered. \"We got to San Francisco a weekago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson\\'s Ranch for a visit while Istayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met. \"\"How long will you be with us?\" he asked. Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas. We\\'ve been away for a long time, you know, and so we\\'re anxious to gethome again. \"The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and lookedthoughtful. Next minute therewas a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the groundopen in a wide crack and then come together again. \"Goodness!\" she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat. \"\"That was an awful big quake,\" replied Zeb, with a white face. \"Italmost got us that time, Dorothy.\"The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock. Then the boy crackedhis whip and touched the animal\\'s flanks with it, and after a low moanof protest Jim stepped slowly along the road. Neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes. The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds asit swept over the valley. Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split intoanother great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing. Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same. Thesudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think. The horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifyingnoises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments thelittle girl lost consciousness. Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but hewas badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip,expecting every moment would be his last. [Illustration][Illustration]CHAPTER 2. THE GLASS CITYWhen Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not sofast. The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this greatcrack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was about toovertake them at any moment. Crash after crash echoed far above theirheads, as the earth came together where it had split, and stones andchunks of clay rattled around them on every side. These they could notsee, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and Jim screamedalmost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck hisboney body. They did not really hurt the poor horse, because everythingwas falling together; only the stones and rubbish fell faster than thehorse and buggy, which were held back by the pressure of the air, sothat the terrified animal was actually more frightened than he wasinjured. How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,she was so greatly bewildered. But bye and bye, as she stared ahead intothe black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the form ofthe horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his long legssprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space. Also, turningher head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had untilnow remained as still and silent as she herself. Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier. With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head overthe side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from. Far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air. This splendid group of colored suns sent raysdarting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy andZeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the raysbegan to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing moreand more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantlyilluminated. Dorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim\\'s big earsturn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail shouldbe yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes ofa zebra. Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and whose hair waspink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous. \"Isn\\'t it funny?\" she said. The boy was startled and his eyes were big. Dorothy had a green streakthrough the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights cametogether, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright. \"I--I don\\'t s-s-see any-thing funny--\\'bout it!\" he stammered. [Illustration: HORSE, BUGGY AND ALL FELL SLOWLY.]Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of thehorse tipping also. But they continued to fall, all together, and theboy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as theywere before. Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to rollslowly over until they were right side up again. During this time Jimstruggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on findinghimself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone ofvoice:\"Well, that\\'s better!\"Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder. \"Can your horse talk?\" she asked. \"Never knew him to, before,\" replied the boy. \"Those were the first words I ever said,\" called out the horse, who hadoverheard them, \"and I can\\'t explain why I happened to speak then. Thisis a nice scrape you\\'ve got me into, isn\\'t it? \"\"As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,\" answered Dorothy,cheerfully. \"But never mind; something will happen pretty soon. \"\"Of course,\" growled the horse; \"and then we shall be sorry ithappened. All this was so terrible and unreal that he could notunderstand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid. Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed closebeside them. There was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they hadpassed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercingrays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again. \"We\\'ve got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deepsigh. \"\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy. \"We are somewhere in the middle of theearth, and the chances are we\\'ll reach the other side of it before long. But it\\'s a big hollow, isn\\'t it? \"\"Awful big!\" answered the boy. \"We\\'re coming to something now,\" announced the horse. At this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and lookeddown. Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away, either. Here and there weregroups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they sparkledso brightly. \"I\\'m sure we are in no danger,\" said Dorothy, in a sober voice. \"\"We\\'ll never get home again, though!\" declared Zeb, with a groan. \"Oh, I\\'m not so sure of that,\" replied the girl. \"The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soonboth were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread outbelow them. They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a bigcity which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharp-pointedspires. These spires were like great spear-points, and if they tumbledupon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury. Jim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straightup with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense. Butno; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a stopat last. When Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beast\\'s legstrembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at once leaped outof the buggy to the roof, and he was so awkward and hasty that he kickedover Dorothy\\'s birdcage, which rolled out upon the roof so that thebottom came off. At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage, satdown upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round eyes. \"Oh,\" said Dorothy. \"\"First time I ever saw a pink cat,\" said Zeb. \"Eureka isn\\'t pink; she\\'s white. \"\"Where\\'s my milk?\" asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy\\'s face. \"\"Oh, Eureka! Can you talk?\"\"Talk! Good gracious, I believe I am. Isn\\'t it funny? \"asked the kitten. \"It\\'s all wrong,\" said Zeb, gravely. \"Animals ought not to talk. Buteven old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident. \"\"I can\\'t see that it\\'s wrong,\" remarked Jim, in his gruff tones. \"Atleast, it isn\\'t as wrong as some other things. What\\'s going to become ofus now? \"\"I don\\'t know,\" answered the boy, looking around him curiously. The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparentthat one could look through the walls as easily as though a window. Dorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms usedfor rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of queerforms huddled into the corners of these rooms. The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces ofglass were lying scattered in every direction. The rainbow tints from the coloredsuns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings manydelicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see. But not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers hadarrived, except that of their own voices. There wasno expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet hemust have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had restedupon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked rapidly tothe furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his shoulder togaze at the strange animal. cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did notlook where he was going; \"be careful, or you\\'ll fall off! He reached the edge of the tallroof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as calmlyas if he were on firm ground. The girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof, andsaw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground. Soon hereached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into one ofthe glass buildings. \"How strange!\" she exclaimed, drawing a long breath. \"Yes; but it\\'s lots of fun, if it _is_ strange,\" remarked the smallvoice of the kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in theair a foot or so away from the edge of the roof. \"Come back, Eureka!\" she called, in distress, \"you\\'ll certainly bekilled. \"\"I have nine lives,\" said the kitten, purring softly as it walked aroundin a circle and then came back to the roof; \"but I can\\'t lose even oneof them by falling in this country, because I really couldn\\'t manage tofall if I wanted to. \"\"Does the air bear up your weight?\" asked the girl. \"Of course; can\\'t you see?\" and again the kitten wandered into the airand back to the edge of the roof. \"It\\'s wonderful!\" said Dorothy. \"Suppose we let Eureka go down to the street and get some one to helpus,\" suggested Zeb, who had been even more amazed than Dorothy at thesestrange happenings. \"Perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves,\" replied the girl. Zeb drew back with a shiver. \"I wouldn\\'t dare try,\" he said. \"May be Jim will go,\" continued Dorothy, looking at the horse. \"And may be he won\\'t!\" answered Jim. \"I\\'ve tumbled through the air longenough to make me contented on this roof. \"\"But we didn\\'t tumble to the roof,\" said the girl; \"by the time wereached here we were floating very slowly, and I\\'m almost sure we couldfloat down to the street without getting hurt. Eureka walks on the airall right. \"\"Eureka weighs only about half a pound,\" replied the horse, in ascornful tone, \"while I weigh about half a ton. \"\"You don\\'t weigh as much as you ought to, Jim,\" remarked the girl,shaking her head as she looked at the animal. \"You\\'re dreadfullyskinny. \"\"Oh, well; I\\'m old,\" said the horse, hanging his head despondently, \"andI\\'ve had lots of trouble in my day, little one. \"\"He eats enough to get fat, I\\'m sure,\" said the boy, gravely. Can you remember any breakfast that I\\'ve had today?\" \"None of us has had breakfast,\" said the boy; \"and in a time of dangerlike this it\\'s foolish to talk about eating. \"\"Nothing is more dangerous than being without food,\" declared the horse,with a sniff at the rebuke of his young master; \"and just at present noone can tell whether there are any oats in this queer country or not. Ifthere are, they are liable to be glass oats! \"[Illustration: \"COME ON, JIM! IT\\'S ALL RIGHT.\"]\"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Dorothy. But I wish we could finda way to get to the ground. \"\"Why don\\'t you walk down?\" asked Eureka. \"I\\'m as hungry as the horse is, \"\"Will you try it, Zeb\" asked the girl, turning to her companion. But he did notwish the little girl to think him a coward, so he advanced slowly to theedge of the roof. Dorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let itrest in the air a little over the edge of the roof. Dorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him, and soon they were bothwalking through the air, with the kitten frisking beside them. \"Come on, Jim!\" called the boy. \"It\\'s all right.\" Jim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over, and being a sensiblehorse and quite experienced, he made up his mind that he could go wherethe others did. So, with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of his shorttail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began floatingdownward to the street. \"Well, well!\" said Dorothy, drawing a long breath, \"What a strangecountry this is. There were men and women,but no children at all, and the folks were all beautifully formed andattractively dressed and had wonderfully handsome faces. There was notan ugly person in all the throng, yet Dorothy was not especially pleasedby the appearance of these people because their features had no moreexpression than the faces of dolls. They did not smile nor did theyfrown, or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness. They simply stared at the strangers, paying most attention to Jim andEureka, for they had never before seen either a horse or a cat and thechildren bore an outward resemblance to themselves. Pretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in thedark hair just over his forehead. He seemed to be a person of authority,for the others pressed back to give him room. After turning his composedeyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he said to Zeb,who was a little taller than Dorothy:\"Tell me, intruder, was it you who caused the Rain of Stones? \"For a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question. Then,remembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them longbefore they had reached this place, he answered:\"No, sir; we didn\\'t cause anything. \"The man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over thisspeech. Then he asked:\"What is an earthquake?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" said Zeb, who was still confused. But Dorothy, seeinghis perplexity, answered:\"It\\'s a shaking of the earth. In this quake a big crack opened and wefell through--horse and buggy, and all--and the stones got loose andcame down with us. \"The man with the star regarded her with his calm, expressionless eyes. \"The Rain of Stones has done much damage to our city,\" he said; \"and weshall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence. asked the girl. \"That I am not prepared to say. the girl enquired. \"I will lead you to it. Come! \"He turned and walked down the street, and after a moment\\'s hesitationDorothy caught Eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy. The boytook his seat beside her and said: \"Gid-dap, Jim. \"As the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glasscity made way for them and formed a procession in their rear. [Illustration]CHAPTER 3. THE ARRIVAL OF THE WIZARDThe doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse andbuggy to enter, so Zeb drove straight through it and the children foundthemselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful. The people at oncefollowed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room,leaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy thecenter of the hall. \"Come to us, oh, Gwig!\" called the man, in a loud voice. He was formed just aswere the other inhabitants of this land and his clothing only differedfrom theirs in being bright yellow. There was even athorn upon the tip of his nose and he looked so funny that Dorothylaughed when she saw him. The Sorcerer, hearing the laugh, looked toward the little girl withcold, cruel eyes, and his glance made her grow sober in an instant. \"Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secludedLand of the Mangaboos?\" he asked, sternly. \"\\'Cause we couldn\\'t help it ,\" said Dorothy. \"Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack andbreak our houses?\" he continued. \"We didn\\'t,\" declared the girl. \"Prove it!\" cried the Sorcerer. \"We don\\'t have to prove it,\" answered Dorothy, indignantly. \"\"We only know that yesterday came a Rain of Stones upon us, which didmuch damage and injured some of our people. Today came another Rain ofStones, and soon after it you appeared among us. \"\"By the way,\" said the man with the star, looking steadily at theSorcerer, \"you told us yesterday that there would not be a second Rainof Stones. Yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the first. What is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth? \"\"My sorcery does tell the truth!\" declared the thorn-covered man. \"Isaid there would be but one Rain of Stones. This second one was a Rainof People-and-Horse-and-Buggy. And some stones came with them. \"\"Will there be any more Rains?\" asked the man with the star. \"No, my Prince. \"\"Neither stones nor people? \"\"No, my Prince. \"\"Are you sure? \"\"Quite sure, my Prince. \"Just then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Princeafter making a low bow. \"More wonders in the air, my Lord,\" said he. Immediately the Prince and all of his people flocked out of the hallinto the street, that they might see what was about to happen. Dorothyand Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them, but the Sorcererremained calmly in his throne. Far up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon. It was all they could do, for to goaway and leave that strange sight was impossible; nor could they hurryits fall in any way. The earth children were not noticed, being so nearthe average size of the Mangaboos, and the horse had remained in theHouse of the Sorcerer, with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of thebuggy. Dorothy was surprised to find howpatient the people were, for her own little heart was beating rapidlywith excitement. A balloon meant to her some other arrival from thesurface of the earth, and she hoped it would be some one able to assisther and Zeb out of their difficulties. Then a little man jumped out of the basket, took off his tall hat, andbowed very gracefully to the crowd of Mangaboos around him. He was quitean old little man, and his head was long and entirely bald. \"Why,\" cried Dorothy, in amazement, \"it\\'s Oz!\" The little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as shewas. But he smiled and bowed as he answered:\"Yes, my dear; I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. And you are littleDorothy, from Kansas. I remember you very well. \"\"Who did you say it was?\" whispered Zeb to the girl. \"It\\'s the wonderful Wizard of Oz. Haven\\'t you heard of him? \"Just then the man with the star came and stood before the Wizard. \"Sir,\" said he, \"why are you here, in the Land of the Mangaboos?\"\"Didn\\'t know what land it was, my son,\" returned the other, with apleasant smile; \"and, to be honest, I didn\\'t mean to visit you when Istarted out. I live on top of the earth, your honor, which is far betterthan living inside it; but yesterday I went up in a balloon, and when Icame down I fell into a big crack in the earth, caused by an earthquake. So I continued todescend until I reached this place, and if you will show me a way to getout of it, I\\'ll go with pleasure. \"The Prince had listened with attention. Said he:\"This child, who is from the crust of the earth, like yourself, calledyou a Wizard. Is not a Wizard something like a Sorcerer? \"\"It\\'s better,\" replied Oz, promptly. \"One Wizard is worth threeSorcerers. \"\"Ah, you shall prove that,\" said the Prince. \"We Mangaboos have, at thepresent time, one of the most wonderful Sorcerers that ever was pickedfrom a bush; but he sometimes makes mistakes. \"\"Never!\" declared the Wizard, boldly. \"Oh, Oz!\" said Dorothy; \"you made a lot of mistakes when you were in themarvelous Land of Oz.\"\"Nonsense!\" said the little man, turning red--although just then a rayof violet sunlight was on his round face. \"Come with me,\" said the Prince to him. \"I wish you to meet ourSorcerer. \"The Wizard did not like this invitation, but he could not refuse toaccept it. So he followed the Prince into the great domed hall, andDorothy and Zeb came after them, while the throng of people trooped inalso. \"What an absurd creature!\" he exclaimed. \"He may look absurd,\" said the Prince, in his quiet voice; \"but he is anexcellent Sorcerer. The only fault I find with him is that he is sooften wrong. \"\"I am never wrong,\" answered the Sorcerer. \"Only a short time ago you told me there would be no more Rain of Stonesor of People,\" said the Prince. \"Well, what then?\"\"Here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong. \"\"One person cannot be called \\'people,\\'\" said the Sorcerer. \"If twoshould come out of the sky you might with justice say I was wrong; butunless more than this one appears I will hold that I was right. \"\"Very clever,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head as if pleased. \"I amdelighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top ofit. \"\"No,\" said the Sorcerer. \"You ought to join one,\" declared the little man seriously. It\\'s a fine aggregation, I assure you. \"\"What do you do?\" asked the Sorcerer. But never mind. It isn\\'t everybodywho gets a chance to see your Land of the Gabazoos. \"\"Mangaboos,\" said the Sorcerer, correcting him. \"If you are a Wizard youought to be able to call people by their right names. \"\"Oh, I\\'m a Wizard; you may be sure of that. Just as good a Wizard as youare a Sorcerer. \"\"That remains to be seen,\" said the other. \"If you are able to prove that you are better,\" said the Prince to thelittle man, \"I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain. Otherwise--\"\"What will happen otherwise?\" asked the Wizard. \"I will stop you from living, and forbid you to be planted,\" returnedthe Prince. \"That does not sound especially pleasant,\" said the little man, lookingat the one with the star uneasily. \"But never mind. I\\'ll beat OldPrickly, all right. \"\"My name is Gwig,\" said the Sorcerer, turning his heartless, cruel eyesupon his rival. \"Let me see you equal the sorcery I am about toperform. \"He waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard,playing sweet music. Yet, look where she would, Dorothy could discoverno bells at all in the great glass hall. The Mangaboo people listened, but showed no great interest. It was oneof the things Gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer. Now was the Wizard\\'s turn, so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked:\"Will somebody kindly loan me a hat?\"No one did, because the Mangaboos did not wear hats, and Zeb had losthis, somehow, in his flight through the air. \"Ahem!\" said the Wizard, \"will somebody please loan me a handkerchief? \"Very good,\" remarked the Wizard. \"I\\'ll use my own hat, if you please. Now, good people, observe me carefully. You see, there is nothing up mysleeve and nothing concealed about my person. He took off his hat and held it upside down, shaking itbriskly. \"Let me see it,\" said the Sorcerer. He took the hat and examined it carefully, returning it afterward to theWizard. \"Now,\" said the little man, \"I will create something out of nothing. \"He placed the hat upon the glass floor, made a pass with his hand, and then removed the hat, displaying a little white piglet no bigger than amouse, which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squealin a tiny, shrill voice. The people watched it intently, for they had never seen a pig before,big or little. He placed one upon the floor, so that it could run around, and pulledapart the other, making three piglets in all; and then one of these waspulled apart, making four piglets. \"Now,\" said the Wizard of Oz, \"having created something from nothing, Iwill make something nothing again. And so, one by one, the nine tinypiglets were pushed together until but a single one of the creaturesremained. When he removed his hat the last piglet had disappearedentirely. The little man gave a bow to the silent throng that had watched him, andthen the Prince said, in his cold, calm voice:\"You are indeed a wonderful Wizard, and your powers are greater thanthose of my Sorcerer. \"\"He will not be a wonderful Wizard long,\" remarked Gwig. \"Because I am going to stop your breath,\" was the reply. \"The little man looked troubled. \"How long will it take you to stop my breath?\" he asked. I\\'m going to begin now. \"He began making queer signs and passes toward the Wizard; but the littleman did not watch him long. Dorothy screamed and expected to see a terrible sight; but as the twohalves of the Sorcerer fell apart on the floor she saw that he had nobones or blood inside of him at all, and that the place where he was cutlooked much like a sliced turnip or potato. cried the Wizard, astonished. \"Of course,\" said the Prince. \"We are all vegetable, in this country. \"\"No,\" answered the Wizard. \"People on top of the earth are all meat. Will your Sorcerer die? Sowe must plant him at once, that other Sorcerers may grow upon his bush,\"continued the Prince. \"What do you mean by that?\" asked the little Wizard, greatly puzzled. \"If you will accompany me to our public gardens,\" replied the Prince, \"Iwill explain to you much better than I can here the mysteries of ourVegetable Kingdom. \"[Illustration: THE WIZARD CUT THE SORCERER EXACTLY IN TWO.] CHAPTER 4. Jim pricked up his ears when he heard they were going to the gardens,and wanted to join the party, thinking he might find something proper toeat; so Zeb put down the top of the buggy and invited the Wizard to ridewith them. The seat was amply wide enough for the little man and the twochildren, and when Jim started to leave the hall the kitten jumped uponhis back and sat there quite contentedly. So the procession moved through the streets, the bearers of the Sorcererfirst, the Prince next, then Jim drawing the buggy with the strangersinside of it, and last the crowd of vegetable people who had no heartsand could neither smile nor frown. The glass city had several fine streets, for a good many people livedthere; but when the procession had passed through these it came upon abroad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks thatflowed through it. There were paths through these gardens, and over someof the brooks were ornamental glass bridges. Dorothy and Zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the Prince,so that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better. \"Who built these lovely bridges?\" asked the little girl. \"No one built them,\" answered the man with the star. \"They grow. \"\"That\\'s queer,\" said she. \"Did the glass houses in your city grow, too?\"\"Of course,\" he replied. \"But it took a good many years for them to growas large and fine as they are now. That is why we are so angry when aRain of Stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs. \"No; but they will grow together again, in time, and we must wait untilthey do. \"They first passed through many beautiful gardens of flowers, which grewnearest the city; but Dorothy could hardly tell what kind of flowersthey were, because the colors were constantly changing under theshifting lights of the six suns. When they passed over a field of grass Jim immediately stretched downhis head and began to nibble. \"A nice country this is,\" he grumbled, \"where a respectable horse has toeat pink grass! \"\"It\\'s violet,\" said the Wizard, who was in the buggy. \"Now it\\'s blue,\" complained the horse. \"As a matter of fact, I\\'m eatingrainbow grass. \"\"How does it taste?\" asked the Wizard. \"Not bad at all,\" said Jim. \"If they give me plenty of it I\\'ll notcomplain about its color. \"By this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field, and thePrince said to Dorothy:\"This is our planting-ground. \"Several Mangaboos came forward with glass spades and dug a hole in theground. After that other people brought water from a brook and sprinkledthe earth. \"He will sprout very soon,\" said the Prince, \"and grow into a largebush, from which we shall in time be able to pick several very goodsorcerers. \"\"Do all your people grow on bushes?\" asked the boy. \"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"Do not all people grow upon bushes whereyou came from, on the outside of the earth. \"\"Not that I ever heard of. \"\"How strange! But if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens Iwill show you the way we grow in the Land of the Mangaboos.\" There were no stairs in their houses, because they did not need them,but on a level surface they generally walked just as we do. The little party of strangers now followed the Prince across a few moreof the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a gardenenclosed by a high hedge. Jim had refused to leave the field of grass,where he was engaged in busily eating; so the Wizard got out of thebuggy and joined Zeb and Dorothy, and the kitten followed demurely attheir heels. This sight explained toDorothy why she had seen no children among the Mangaboos, a thing shehad until now been unable to account for. \"Our people do not acquire their real life until they leave theirbushes,\" said the Prince. So while they grow they cannot be said to really live, andthey must be picked before they can become good citizens. \"\"How long do you live, after you are picked?\" asked Dorothy. \"That depends upon the care we take of ourselves,\" he replied. I\\'ve been picked over six years, but our family is known to beespecially long lived. \"\"Do you eat?\" asked the boy. \"Eat! We are quite solid inside our bodies, and have no needto eat, any more than does a potato. \"\"But the potatoes sometimes sprout,\" said Zeb. \"And sometimes we do,\" answered the Prince; \"but that is considered agreat misfortune, for then we must be planted at once. \"\"Where did you grow?\" asked the Wizard. \"I will show you,\" was the reply. \"Step this way, please. \"This,\" said he, \"is the Royal Bush of the Mangaboos. All of our Princesand Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial. On the central stalk stoodpoised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and solovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thoughtshe had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life. Herflesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressedboth dignity and grace. \"Who is this?\" asked the Wizard, curiously. The Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush. Now heanswered, with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones:\"She is the Ruler destined to be my successor, for she is a RoyalPrincess. \"\"Isn\\'t she ripe now?\" asked Dorothy. \"Not quite,\" said he, finally. \"It will be several days before she needsto be picked, or at least that is my judgment. I am in no hurry toresign my office and be planted, you may be sure. \"\"Probably not,\" declared the Wizard, nodding. \"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives,\"continued the Prince, with a sigh, \"that while we are in our full primewe must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sproutand grow and give birth to other people. \"\"I\\'m sure the Princess is ready to be picked,\" asserted Dorothy, gazinghard at the beautiful girl on the bush. \"\"Never mind,\" answered the Prince, hastily, \"she will be all right for afew days longer, and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose ofyou strangers, who have come to our land uninvited and must be attendedto at once. \"\"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Zeb. \"That is a matter I have not quite decided upon,\" was the reply. \"\"You needn\\'t worry,\" said Dorothy. \"We wouldn\\'t grow under ground, I\\'msure. \"\"But why destroy my friends?\" asked the little Wizard. \"Why not let themlive? \"\"They do not belong here,\" returned the Prince. \"They have no right tobe inside the earth at all. \"\"We didn\\'t ask to come down here; we fell,\" said Dorothy. \"That is no excuse,\" declared the Prince, coldly. The children looked at each other in perplexity, and the Wizard sighed. Eureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft, purring voice:\"He won\\'t need to destroy _me_, for if I don\\'t get something to eatpretty soon I shall starve to death, and so save him the trouble. \"\"If he planted you, he might grow some cat-tails,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Oh, Eureka! perhaps we can find you some milk-weeds to eat,\" said theboy. \"Phoo!\" snarled the kitten; \"I wouldn\\'t touch the nasty things! \"\"You don\\'t need milk, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy; \"you are big enough nowto eat any kind of food. \"\"If I can get it,\" added Eureka. \"I\\'m hungry myself,\" said Zeb. \"But I noticed some strawberries growingin one of the gardens, and some melons in another place. These peopledon\\'t eat such things, so perhaps on our way back they will let us getthem. \"\"Never mind your hunger,\" interrupted the Prince. \"I shall order youdestroyed in a few minutes, so you will have no need to ruin our prettymelon vines and berry bushes. Follow me, please, to meet your doom.\" CHAPTER 5. DOROTHY PICKS THE PRINCESSThe words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not verycomforting, and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure. The children, feeling sad and despondent, were about to follow him whenthe Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder. \"Wait!\" he whispered. \"What for?\" asked the girl. \"Suppose we pick the Royal Princess,\" said the Wizard. \"I\\'m quite sure she\\'s ripe, and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler, andmay treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to. \"\"All right!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly. \"Let\\'s pick her while we havethe chance, before the man with the star comes back. \"So together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized onehand of the lovely Princess. \"Pull!\" cried Dorothy, and as they did so the royal lady leaned towardthem and the stems snapped and separated from her feet. She was not atall heavy, so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to theground. The beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant, tuckedin a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a lookaround the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a sweetbut even toned voice:\"I thank you very much. \"\"We salute your Royal Highness!\" cried the Wizard, kneeling and kissingher hand. Just then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to hasten,and a moment later he returned to the enclosure, followed by a number ofhis people. Instantly the Princess turned and faced him, and when he saw that shewas picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble. \"Sir,\" said the Royal Lady, with much dignity, \"you have wronged megreatly, and would have wronged me still more had not these strangerscome to my rescue. \"\"I did not know that you were ripe,\" answered the Prince, in a lowvoice. \"Give me the Star of Royalty!\" Slowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it uponthat of the Princess. Then all the people bowed low to her, and thePrince turned and walked away alone. What became of him afterward ourfriends never knew. The people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession andmarched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palaceand to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion. But while thepeople in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked inthe air just above their heads, to show that she was a superior beingand more exalted than her subjects. No one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers, so Dorothy andZeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselvesinto the vegetable gardens. This was a very interestingexperience to them, and Dorothy said:\"I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air. \"\"Perhaps,\" answered the Wizard, \"it is because we are close to thecenter of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very slight. \"\"Is this a fairy country?\" asked the boy. \"Of course it is,\" returned Dorothy, promptly. \"Only a fairy countrycould have veg\\'table people; and only in a fairy country could Eurekaand Jim talk as we do. \"\"That\\'s true,\" said Zeb, thoughtfully. But the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat, andcalled the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk bymeans of his magical arts. As they sat upon the grass watching Jim, who was still busily eating,Eureka said:\"I don\\'t believe you are a Wizard at all! \"\"No,\" answered the little man, \"you are quite right. \"\"The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug,\" agreed Dorothy. \"I\\'ve knownhim for a long time. \"\"If that is so,\" said the boy, \"how could he do that wonderful trickwith the nine tiny piglets? \"\"Don\\'t know,\" said Dorothy, \"but it must have been humbug. \"\"Very true,\" declared the Wizard, nodding at her. \"It was necessary todeceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince, as well as their stupidpeople; but I don\\'t mind telling you, who are my friends, that the thingwas only a trick. \"\"But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes!\" exclaimed Zeb. \"So did I,\" purred the kitten. \"To be sure,\" answered the Wizard. \"You saw them because they werethere. They are in my inside pocket now. \"\"Let\\'s see the pigs,\" said Eureka, eagerly. The little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tinypiglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran aroundand nibbled the tender blades. \"They\\'re hungry, too,\" he said. \"Oh, what cunning things!\" cried Dorothy, catching up one and pettingit. said the piglet, with a squeal, \"you\\'re squeezing me! \"\"Dear me!\" murmured the Wizard, looking at his pets in astonishment. \"They can actually talk! \"\"May I eat one of them?\" asked the kitten, in a pleading voice. \"\"Why, Eureka,\" said Dorothy, reproachfully, \"what a cruel question! Itwould be dreadful to eat these dear little things. \"\"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily atthe kitten; \"cats are cruel things. \"\"I\\'m not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning. \"I\\'m just hungry. \"\"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\" declared thelittle man, in a stern voice. \"They are the only things I have to proveI\\'m a wizard. \"\"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy. \"I never saw suchsmall pigs before. \"\"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"whereeverything is small because it\\'s a small island. \"\"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front ofDorothy and looking pleadingly into her face. And if I can\\'t eat thepiglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup. \"\"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in thesebrooks. Do you like fish? \"\"Fish!\" cried the kitten. \"Do I like fish? \"\"Then I\\'ll try to catch you some,\" said he. \"But won\\'t they be veg\\'table, like everything else here?\" asked thekitten. \"I think not. There is no reason, that I can see, why theymay not exist in the waters of this strange country. [Illustration: IN THE GARDEN OF THE MANGABOOS.]The fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifullycut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine itclosely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and ina few moments it had entirely disappeared. \"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones? \"\"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as itwashed its face after the meal. \"\"You were very greedy,\" said the girl. \"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten. The little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene withfrightened eyes. \"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them. said another. \"Don\\'t worry,\" Dorothy murmured, soothingly, \"I\\'ll not let the kittenhurt you. Eureka stuck up her nose at suchfood, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of thecrackers and ate them up in a jiffy. \"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard. \"That is, if Jimhas had enough of the pink grass. \"The cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh. \"I\\'ve tried to eat a lot while I had the chance,\" said he, \"for it\\'slikely to be a long while between meals in this strange country. But I\\'mready to go, now, at any time you wish. \"So, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket,where they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into thebuggy and Jim started back to the town. \"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl. \"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" repliedthe Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that hewould keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princesswon\\'t know but that we belong there. \"It doesn\\'t look very homelike,\" said Dorothy, gazing around at thebare room. \"But it\\'s a place to stay, anyhow. \"\"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to someopenings that appeared near the top of the dome. \"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs toget to them. \"\"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard. \"Let uswalk up, and see where the doors lead to. \"With this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, andDorothy and Zeb followed him. \"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl. \"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied. \"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when wecame, and if there is no sunset there can be no night. \"\"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard. \"But it is a long time since I have hadany sleep, and I\\'m tired. So I think I shall lie down upon one of thesehard glass benches and take a nap. \"\"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of thehall. Then the boy returnedto one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glassbench was soon deep in slumberland. [Illustration]CHAPTER 6. THE MANGABOOS PROVE DANGEROUSWhen the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon theLand of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival. \"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strangecountry, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell. But inthe basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me. There is nothing else that I care about. \"So the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he hadreturned Dorothy was awake. Then the three held a counsel to decide whatthey should do next, but could think of no way to better theircondition. \"I don\\'t like these veg\\'table people,\" said the little girl. \"They\\'recold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness. It is because there is no warm blood in them,\"remarked the Wizard. \"And they have no hearts; so they can\\'t love anyone--not eventhemselves,\" declared the boy. \"The Princess is lovely to look at,\" continued Dorothy, thoughtfully;\"but I don\\'t care much for her, after all. If there was any other placeto go, I\\'d like to go there. \"\"But _is_ there any other place?\" asked the Wizard. \"I don\\'t know,\" she answered. Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them,and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess anda throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer. So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said tothem:\"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we havedecided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must notremain here. \"\"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy. \"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was theanswer. \"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard. \"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\"said the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodiesto make themselves grow bigger. The animals you have with you we willdrive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit. Then our country willbe rid of all its unwelcome visitors. \"\"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one ofthose growing is yet ripe enough to pick. Why destroy me?\"\"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I aminformed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, totake the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for himto be planted. Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able toperform. \"At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick ofproducing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again. He didit very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strangepiglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person couldbe. But afterward she said:\"I have heard of this wonderful magic. But it accomplishes nothing ofvalue. What else can you do?\"The Wizard tried to think. But eventhat did not satisfy the Princess. \"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic bycreating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit aDestroyer much more dreadful than your Clinging Vines.\" So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other andset a lantern upon each of their heads. \"Don\\'t laugh,\" he whispered to them, \"or you will spoil the effect of mymagic. \"[Illustration: \"NOW, PRINCESS,\" EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD.]Then, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkledface, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns. TheMangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen anylight that did not come directly from their suns. Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor,where it covered quite a broad surface. \"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors whowished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step withinthis circle of light. If they advised you well, and were in the right,they will not be injured in any way. But if any advised you wrongly, thelight will wither him. \"The advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commandedthem to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and werescorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that ofbaked potatoes. \"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than anySorcerer we have ever known. As it is evident that my people haveadvised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadfulGarden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into theBlack Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have themaround. \"The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himselfthat he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had goneboth Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit,and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them fromsuch a fate. For two or three days after this--if we call days the periods betweensleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friendswere not disturbed in any way. Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, andwalking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest. They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where shelay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her. The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches andwatched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval. \"Don\\'t be rough!\" Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch coveredwith sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, thekitten and the piglets. \"Here--stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after beingpricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the wayof the thorns. Here were more of thevegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now frightenedcreatures down the street. Jim had to be careful not to step upon thetiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing, whileEureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her, also triedto protect the pretty little things from injury. \"What does all this mean, anyhow?\" asked the horse, jumping to escape athorn. \"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which theythreatened to cast us,\" replied the kitten. \"If I were as big as youare, Jim, I\\'d fight these miserable turnip-roots! \"I\\'d kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs. \"\"All right,\" said the horse; \"I\\'ll do it. Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy andscratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many vegetablecomplexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did the horse. But the foes were too many to be repulsed for long. [Illustration]CHAPTER 7. INTO THE BLACK PIT AND OUT AGAINWhen they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged, towering chunkof deep green glass, and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme. Half way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond thepoint where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it. The Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into thisdark hole and then, having pushed the buggy in after them--for it seemedsome of them had dragged it all the way from the domed hall--they beganto pile big glass rocks within the entrance, so that the prisoners couldnot get out again. \"\"If the Wizard was here,\" said one of the piglets, sobbing bitterly, \"hewould not see us suffer so. \"\"We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked,\"added Eureka. \"But never mind; be brave, my friends, and I will go andtell our masters where you are, and get them to come to your rescue. \"The mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now, but the kitten gave aleap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into theair. Eureka,however, was lighter than the Mangaboos, and while they could mount onlyabout a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could gonearly two hundred feet. So she ran along over their heads until she hadleft them far behind and below and had come to the city and the House ofthe Sorcerer. There she entered in at Dorothy\\'s window in the dome andaroused her from her sleep. As soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened theWizard and Zeb, and at once preparations were made to go to the rescueof Jim and the piglets. Dorothy\\'swicker suit-case was still under the seat of the buggy, and by goodfortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he hadtaken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest. So there wasnothing for the girl to carry but the kitten, which she held close toher bosom and tried to comfort, for its little heart was still beatingrapidly. Before long they neared the Black Pit, where a busy swarm of Mangaboos,headed by their Princess, was engaged in piling up glass rocks beforethe entrance. \"Stop, I command you!\" cried the Wizard, in an angry tone, and at oncebegan pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets. Instead ofopposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made agood-sized hole in the barrier, when by order of the Princess they allsprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns. [Illustration: THROUGH THE BLACK PIT.]Dorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked, and Zeb andthe Wizard, after enduring a few stabs from the thorns, were glad tofollow her. At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glassagain, and as the little man realized that they were all about to beentombed in the mountain he said to the children:\"My dears, what shall we do? Jump out and fight? \"\"What\\'s the use?\" replied Dorothy. \"\"That\\'s the way I feel about it,\" remarked Zeb, rubbing his wounds. \"I\\'ve had enough of the Mangaboos. \"\"All right,\" said the Wizard; \"I\\'m with you, whatever you decide. But wecan\\'t live long in this cavern, that\\'s certain. \"Noticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets,patted each one lovingly on its fat little head, and placed themcarefully in his inside pocket. \"How big is this hole?\" asked Dorothy. \"I\\'ll explore it and see,\" replied the boy. So he carried the lantern back for quite a distance, while Dorothy andthe Wizard followed at his side. The cavern did not come to an end, asthey had expected it would, but slanted upward through the great glassmountain, running in a direction that promised to lead them to the sideopposite the Mangaboo country. \"The others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion, and at once theboy began to harness Jim to the buggy. When all was in readiness thethree took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along theway, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lightedlantern so the horse could see where to go. Jim stopped sometimes to rest, for the climb was rather steepand tiresome. \"We must be nearly as high as the six colored suns, by this time,\" saidDorothy. \"I didn\\'t know this mountain was so tall. \"\"We are certainly a good distance away from the Land of the Mangaboos,\"added Zeb; \"for we have slanted away from it ever since we started. The sides ofthe tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, andthe floor became more level. [Illustration]CHAPTER 8. THE VALLEY OF VOICESBy journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightfulvalley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with anotherrugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and prettygreen hills at the ends. Several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticedtwo very singular and unusual facts about this valley. The second and even more singular fact was the absence ofany inhabitant of this splendid place. From their elevated position theycould overlook the entire valley, but not a single moving object couldthey see. The mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar togranite. The nearest cottage was still some distanceaway. \"Isn\\'t it fine?\" cried Dorothy, in a joyous voice, as she sprang out ofthe buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass. \"Yes, indeed!\" answered Zeb. \"We were lucky to get away from thosedreadful vegetable people. \"\"It wouldn\\'t be so bad,\" remarked the Wizard, gazing around him, \"if wewere obliged to live here always. We couldn\\'t find a prettier place, I\\'msure. \"He took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass, andJim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was verycontented in his new surroundings. \"We can\\'t walk in the air here, though,\" called Eureka, who had tried itand failed; but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground, and theWizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth than they hadbeen in the Mangaboo country, for everything was more homelike andnatural. \"But where are the people?\" asked Dorothy. The little man shook his bald head. \"Can\\'t imagine, my dear,\" he replied. They heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find thecreature anywhere. Thefruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant, and looked so appetizingand delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed:\"What is it, do you s\\'pose?\"The piglets had smelled the fruit quickly, and before the girl couldreach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones hadrushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness. \"It\\'s good, anyway,\" said Zeb, \"or those little rascals wouldn\\'t havegobbled it up so greedily. \"\"Where are they?\" asked Dorothy, in astonishment. They all looked around, but the piglets had disappeared. \"Dear me!\" cried the Wizard; \"they must have run away. But I didn\\'t seethem go; did you?\"\"No!\" replied the boy and the girl, together. Several squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet, but theWizard could not discover a single piglet. \"Where are you?\" he asked. \"Why, right beside you,\" spoke a tiny voice. \"Can\\'t you see us?\"[Illustration: \"ARE THERE REALLY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM?\"]\"No,\" answered the little man, in a puzzled tone. \"We can see you,\" said another of the piglets. He picked it up, but could not see what heheld. \"It is very strange,\" said he, soberly. \"The piglets have becomeinvisible, in some curious way. \"\"I\\'ll bet it\\'s because they ate that peach!\" cried the kitten. \"It wasn\\'t a peach, Eureka,\" said Dorothy. \"\"It was fine, Dorothy,\" called one of the piglets. \"We\\'ll eat all we can find of them,\" said another. mus\\'n\\'t eat them,\" the Wizard warned the children, \"or we toomay become invisible, and lose each other. If we come across another ofthe strange fruit we must avoid it.\" Calling the piglets to him he picked them all up, one by one, and putthem away in his pocket; for although he could not see them he couldfeel them, and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe forthe present. It was a pretty place, with vines growing thicklyover the broad front porch. The meatwas smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange anticsand jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way. But not a singleperson appeared to be in the room. \"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy, who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood inthe doorway. A peal of merry laughter answered her, and the knives and forks fell tothe plates with a clatter. One of the chairs pushed back from the table,and this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almosttempted to run away in fright. \"Here are strangers, mama!\" cried the shrill and childish voice of someunseen person. \"So I see, my dear,\" answered another voice, soft and womanly. \"What do you want?\" demanded a third voice, in a stern, gruff accent. \"Well, well!\" said the Wizard; \"are there really people in this room? \"\"Of course,\" replied the man\\'s voice. \"And--pardon me for the foolish question--but, are you all invisible? \"\"Surely,\" the woman answered, repeating her low, rippling laughter. \"Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe? \"\"Why, yes,\" stammered the Wizard. \"All the people I have ever met beforewere very plain to see. \"\"Where do you come from, then?\" asked the woman, in a curious tone. \"We belong upon the face of the earth,\" explained the Wizard, \"butrecently, during an earthquake, we fell down a crack and landed in theCountry of the Mangaboos. \"\"Dreadful creatures!\" exclaimed the woman\\'s voice. \"I\\'ve heard of them. \"\"They walled us up in a mountain,\" continued the Wizard; \"but we foundthere was a tunnel through to this side, so we came here. It is abeautiful place. \"\"It is the Valley of Voe. \"\"Thank you. We have seen no people since we arrived, so we came to thishouse to enquire our way. \"\"Are you hungry?\" asked the woman\\'s voice. \"I could eat something,\" said Dorothy. \"So could I,\" added Zeb. \"That\\'s all right,\" returned the man\\'s voice, more pleasantly thanbefore. As he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm. Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was surethey were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if thosefolks couldn\\'t be seen. \"What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn? \"enquired the man\\'s voice. \"That\\'s Jim,\" said the girl. \"He\\'s a horse. \"\"What is he good for?\" was the next question. \"Can he fight?\" asked the man\\'s voice. he can kick pretty hard with his heels, and bite a little; but Jimcan\\'t \\'zactly fight,\" she replied. \"Then the bears will get him,\" said one of the children\\'s voices. \"Bears!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Are these bears here? \"\"That is the one evil of our country,\" answered the invisible man. \"Manylarge and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe, and when they cancatch any of us they eat us up; but as they cannot see us, we seldom getcaught. \"\"Are the bears invis\\'ble, too?\" asked the girl. \"Yes; for they eat of the dama-fruit, as we all do, and that keeps themfrom being seen by any eye, whether human or animal. \"\"Does the dama-fruit grow on a low bush, and look something like apeach?\" asked the Wizard. \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"If it makes you invis\\'ble, why do you eat it?\" Dorothy enquired. \"For two reasons, my dear,\" the woman\\'s voice answered. \"The dama-fruitis the most delicious thing that grows, and when it makes us invisiblethe bears cannot find us to eat us up. But now, good wanderers, yourluncheon is on the table, so please sit down and eat as much as youlike. \"[Illustration]CHAPTER 9. THEY FIGHT THE INVISIBLE BEARS The strangers took their seats at the table willingly enough, for theywere all hungry and the platters were now heaped with good things toeat. In front of each place was a plate bearing one of the deliciousdama-fruit, and the perfume that rose from these was so enticing andsweet that they were sorely tempted to eat of them and become invisible. But Dorothy satisfied her hunger with other things, and her companionsdid likewise, resisting the temptation. \"Why do you not eat the damas?\" asked the woman\\'s voice. \"We don\\'t want to get invis\\'ble,\" answered the girl. But if you remain visible the bears will see you and devour you,\" saida girlish young voice, that belonged to one of the children. \"We wholive here much prefer to be invisible; for we can still hug and kiss oneanother, and are quite safe from the bears. \"\"And we do not have to be so particular about our dress,\" remarked theman. \"And mama can\\'t tell whether my face is dirty or not!\" added the otherchildish voice, gleefully. \"But I make you wash it, every time I think of it,\" said the mother;\"for it stands to reason your face is dirty, Ianu, whether I can see itor not. \"Dorothy laughed and stretched out her hands. \"Come here, please--Ianu and your sister--and let me feel of you,\" sherequested. They came to her willingly, and Dorothy passed her hands over theirfaces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age and theother a boy somewhat smaller. The girl\\'s hair was soft and fluffy andher skin as smooth as satin. When Dorothy gently touched her nose andears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed. \"If I could see you I am sure you would be beautiful,\" she declared. The girl laughed, and her mother said:\"We are not vain in the Valley of Voe, because we can not display ourbeauty, and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely toour companions. \"\"How about the birds and beasts and fishes?\" asked Zeb. \"The birds we cannot see, because they love to eat of the damas as muchas we do; yet we hear their sweet songs and enjoy them. Neither can wesee the cruel bears, for they also eat the fruit. But the fishes thatswim in our brooks we can see, and often we catch them to eat. \"\"It occurs to me you have a great deal to make you happy, even whileinvisible,\" remarked the Wizard. \"Nevertheless, we prefer to remainvisible while we are in your valley. \"Just then Eureka came in, for she had been until now wandering outsidewith Jim; and when the kitten saw the table set with food she cried out:\"Now you must feed me, Dorothy, for I\\'m half starved. \"The children were inclined to be frightened by the sight of the smallanimal, which reminded them of the bears; but Dorothy reassured them byexplaining that Eureka was a pet and could do no harm even if she wishedto. Then, as the others had by this time moved away from the table, thekitten sprang upon the chair and put her paws upon the cloth to see whatthere was to eat. To her surprise an unseen hand clutched her and heldher suspended in the air. \"Did you see that, Dorothy?\" \"Yes, dear,\" her mistress replied; \"there are people living in thishouse, although we cannot see them. And you must have better manners,Eureka, or something worse will happen to you. \"She placed a plate of food upon the floor and the kitten ate greedily. \"Give me that nice-smelling fruit I saw on the table,\" she begged, whenshe had cleaned the plate. \"Those are damas,\" said Dorothy, \"and you must never even taste them,Eureka, or you\\'ll get invis\\'ble, and then we can\\'t see you at all. \"The kitten gazed wistfully at the forbidden fruit. \"Does it hurt to be invis\\'ble?\" she asked. \"I don\\'t know,\" Dorothy answered; \"but it would hurt me dre\\'fully tolose you. \"\"Very well, I won\\'t touch it,\" decided the kitten; \"but you must keep itaway from me, for the smell is very tempting. \"\"Can you tell us, sir or ma\\'am,\" said the Wizard, addressing the airbecause he did not quite know where the unseen people stood, \"if thereis any way we can get out of your beautiful Valley, and on top of theEarth again. \"\"Oh, one can leave the Valley easily enough,\" answered the man\\'s voice;\"but to do so you must enter a far less pleasant country. \"\"Oh, no,\" said Dorothy, \"we\\'ve been there, and we know. Even if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary,in order to reach the earth\\'s surface, to keep moving on toward it. \"\"In that case,\" said the man, \"it will be best for you to cross ourValley and mount the spiral staircase inside the Pyramid Mountain. Thetop of that mountain is lost in the clouds, and when you reach it youwill be in the awful Land of Naught, where the Gargoyles live. \"\"What are Gargoyles?\" asked Zeb. \"The wanderers were rather discouraged by this gloomy report, but Dorothysaid with a sigh:\"If the only way to get home is to meet the Gurgles, then we\\'ve got tomeet \\'em. They can\\'t be worse than the Wicked Witch or the Nome King. \"\"But you must remember you had the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to helpyou conquer those enemies,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Just now, my dear,there is not a single warrior in your company. \"\"Oh, I guess Zeb could fight if he had to. Couldn\\'t you, Zeb?\" asked thelittle girl. \"Perhaps; if I had to,\" answered Zeb, doubtfully. \"And you have the jointed sword that you chopped the veg\\'table Sorcererin two with,\" the girl said to the little man. \"True,\" he replied; \"and in my satchel are other useful things to fightwith. \"\"What the Gargoyles most dread is a noise,\" said the man\\'s voice. \"OurChampion told me that when he shouted his battle-cry the creaturesshuddered and drew back, hesitating to continue the combat. \"\"Very good,\" said the Wizard; \"we can all yell better than we can fight,so we ought to defeat the Gargoyles. But tell me,\" said Dorothy, \"how did such a brave Champion happen tolet the bears eat him? And if he was invis\\'ble, and the bears invis\\'ble,who knows that they really ate him up?\"\"The Champion had killed eleven bears in his time,\" returned the unseenman; \"and we know this is true because when any creature is dead theinvisible charm of the dama-fruit ceases to be active, and the slain onecan be plainly seen by all eyes. When the Champion killed a beareveryone could see it; and when the bears killed the Champion we all sawseveral pieces of him scattered about, which of course disappeared againwhen the bears devoured them. They followed the course of a broad stream and passed several morepretty cottages; but of course they saw no one, nor did any one speak tothem. About noon they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a prettyorchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plumsthat grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them:\"There are bears near by. \"The Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip. Dorothy climbed into the buggy, although Jim had been unharnessed fromit and was grazing some distance away. The owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said:\"You cannot escape the bears that way. asked Dorothy, nervously, for an unseen danger isalways the hardest to face. \"You must take to the river,\" was the reply. \"The bears will not ventureupon the water. exclaimed the girl. \"Oh, there is no need of that,\" said the voice, which from its gentletones seemed to belong to a young girl. \"You are strangers in the Valleyof Voe, and do not seem to know our ways; so I will try to save you. \"The next moment a broad-leaved plant was jerked from the ground where itgrew and held suspended in the air before the Wizard. [Illustration: ESCAPING THE INVISIBLE BEARS.]\"Sir,\" said the voice, \"you must rub these leaves upon the soles ofall your feet, and then you will be able to walk upon the water withoutsinking below the surface. It is a secret the bears do not know, and wepeople of Voe usually walk upon the water when we travel, and so escapeour enemies. \"\"Thank you!\" cried the Wizard, joyfully, and at once rubbed a leaf uponthe soles of Dorothy\\'s shoes and then upon his own. The girl took a leafand rubbed it upon the kitten\\'s paws, and the rest of the plant washanded to Zeb, who, after applying it to his own feet, carefully rubbedit upon all four of Jim\\'s hoofs and then upon the tires of thebuggy-wheels. He had nearly finished this last task when a low growlingwas suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciouslywith his heels. \"Quick! To the water, or you are lost!\" cried their unseen friend, andwithout hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out uponthe broad river, for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in herarms. The horse was plunging madly about, and two or three deep gashesappeared upon its flanks, from which the blood flowed freely. Assoon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himselfsafe from pursuit, and Zeb was already running across the water towardDorothy. Thethird time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and afall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear,which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer. Dorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current ofthe water, and the others made haste to join her. The Wizard opened hissatchel and got out some sticking-plaster with which he mended the cutsJim had received from the claws of the bears. \"I think we\\'d better stick to the river, after this,\" said Dorothy. \"\"That is true,\" agreed the Wizard, \"and as the river seems to be flowingin the direction of the Pyramid Mountain it will be the easiest way forus to travel. \"Zeb hitched Jim to the buggy again, and the horse trotted along and drewthem rapidly over the smooth water. The kitten was at first dreadfullyafraid of getting wet, but Dorothy let her down and soon Eureka wasfrisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit. Once alittle fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed it in hermouth and ate it up as quick as a wink; but Dorothy cautioned her to becareful what she ate in this valley of enchantments, and no more fisheswere careless enough to swim within reach. After a journey of several hours they came to a point where the rivercurved, and they found they must cross a mile or so of the Valley beforethey came to the Pyramid Mountain. There were few houses in this part,and few orchards or flowers; so our friends feared they might encountermore of the savage bears, which they had learned to dread with all theirhearts. \"You\\'ll have to make a dash, Jim,\" said the Wizard, \"and run as fast asyou can go. \"\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"I\\'ll do my best. But you must rememberI\\'m old, and my dashing days are past and gone. \"All three got into the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jimneeded no guidance of any sort. The horse was still smarting from thesharp claws of the invisible bears, and as soon as he was on land andheaded toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsomecreatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along ina way that made Dorothy catch her breath. Then Zeb, in a spirit of mischief, uttered a growl like that of thebears, and Jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew. \"I--I\\'m \\'fraid he\\'s--he\\'s running away!\" gasped Dorothy. \"I _know_ he is,\" said Zeb; \"but no bear can catch him if he keeps upthat gait--and the harness or the buggy don\\'t break. Dorothy nearly went with them, but she was holding fast to the iron railof the seat, and that saved her. She squeezed the kitten, though, untilit screeched; and then the old cab-horse made several curious soundsthat led the little girl to suspect he was laughing at them all. [Illustration]CHAPTER 10. THE BRAIDED MAN OF PYRAMID MOUNTAINThe mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that itspoint was lost in the clouds.   These steps lead to the        Land of the Gargoyles. \"I wonder how Jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs,\"said Dorothy, gravely. \"No trouble at all,\" declared the horse, with a contemptuous neigh. \"Still, I don\\'t care to drag any passengers. You\\'ll all have to walk. \"\"Suppose the stairs get steeper?\" suggested Zeb, doubtfully. \"Then you\\'ll have to boost the buggy-wheels, that\\'s all,\" answered Jim. \"We\\'ll try it, anyway,\" said the Wizard. \"It\\'s the only way to get outof the Valley of Voe. \"So they began to ascend the stairs, Dorothy and the Wizard first, Jimnext, drawing the buggy, and then Zeb to watch that nothing happened tothe harness. The light was dim, and soon they mounted into total darkness, so thatthe Wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way. Butthis enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing wherethere was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light andair. Looking through this opening they could see the Valley of Voe lyingfar below them, the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance. After resting a few moments they resumed their climb, and still thestairs were broad and low enough for Jim to draw the buggy easily afterhim. The old horse panted a little, and had to stop often to get hisbreath. At such times they were all glad to wait for him, forcontinually climbing up stairs is sure to make one\\'s legs ache. They wound about, always going upward, for some time. The lights fromthe lanterns dimly showed the way, but it was a gloomy journey, and theywere pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they werecoming to a second landing. Here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it, like the mouth ofa cavern, and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor andcommenced ascending again at the opposite edge. The opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the Valley ofVoe, and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene. Theblues and greys were very beautiful, and Dorothy noticed that on thecloud banks sat or reclined fleecy, shadowy forms of beautiful beingswho must have been the Cloud Fairies. \"Are they real?\" asked Zeb, in an awed voice. \"Of course,\" replied Dorothy, softly. \"\"They seem like open-work,\" remarked the boy, gazing intently. \"If Ishould squeeze one, there wouldn\\'t be anything left of it. suddenly exclaimed the little Wizard. He was a very old man, bent nearly double; but the queerestthing about him was his white hair and beard. \"Where did you come from?\" asked Dorothy, wonderingly. \"No place at all,\" answered the man with the braids; \"that is, notrecently. Once I lived on top the earth, but for many years I have hadmy factory in this spot--half way up Pyramid Mountain. \"\"Are we only half way up?\" enquired the boy, in a discouraged tone. \"I believe so, my lad,\" replied the braided man. as I have neverbeen in either direction, down or up, since I arrived, I cannot bepositive whether it is exactly half way or not. \"\"Have you a factory in this place?\" asked the Wizard, who had beenexamining the strange personage carefully. \"To be sure,\" said the other. \"\"I thought so,\" said the Wizard, with a sigh. \"[Illustration: THE CLOUD FAIRIES.][Illustration: THE BRAIDED MAN.]\"Yes, indeed; come into my shop, please,\" and the braided man turned andled the way into a smaller cave, where he evidently lived. \"This,\" said the man, taking up a box and handling it gently, \"containstwelve dozen rustles--enough to last any lady a year. Will you buy it,my dear?\" he asked, addressing Dorothy. \"My gown isn\\'t silk,\" she said, smiling. \"Never mind. When you open the box the rustles will escape, whether youare wearing a silk dress or not,\" said the man, seriously. Then hepicked up another box. \"In this,\" he continued, \"are many assortedflutters. Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will never bewithout them. \"\"I have no money with me,\" said the Wizard, evasively. \"I do not want money,\" returned the braided man, \"for I could not spendit in this deserted place if I had it. But I would like very much a bluehair-ribbon. \"\"I\\'ll get you one!\" cried Dorothy, who was sorry for the poor man; soshe ran back to the buggy and took from her suit-case a pretty blueribbon. It did her good to see how the braided man\\'s eyes sparkled whenhe received this treasure. \"You have made me very, very happy, my dear!\" he exclaimed; and then heinsisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girlaccepting the box of rustles. \"You may need them, some time,\" he said, \"and there is really no use inmy manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them. \"\"Why did you leave the surface of the earth?\" enquired the Wizard. \"I could not help it. Here, then, I made my home; andalthough it is a lonely place I amuse myself making rustles andflutters, and so get along very nicely. \"When the braided man had completed this strange tale Dorothy nearlylaughed, because it was all so absurd; but the Wizard tapped hisforehead significantly, to indicate that he thought the poor man wascrazy. [Illustration]CHAPTER 11. THEY MEET THE WOODEN GARGOYLESAnother breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landingwhere there was a rift in the mountain. But the travellers were obliged to rest, and while they were sitting onthe rocky floor the Wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the ninetiny piglets. To his delight they were now plainly visible, which provedthat they had passed beyond the influence of the magical Valley of Voe. \"Why, we can see each other again!\" cried one, joyfully. \"Yes,\" sighed Eureka; \"and I also can see you again, and the sightmakes me dreadfully hungry. Please, Mr. Wizard, may I eat just one ofthe fat little piglets? You\\'d never miss _one_ of them, I\\'m sure! \"\"What a horrid, savage beast!\" exclaimed a piglet; \"and after we\\'ve beensuch good friends, too, and played with one another! \"\"When I\\'m not hungry, I love to play with you all,\" said the kitten,demurely; \"but when my stomach is empty it seems that nothing would fillit so nicely as a fat piglet. \"\"And we trusted you so!\" said another of the nine, reproachfully. And thought you were respectable!\" said another. \"It seems we were mistaken,\" declared a third, looking at the kittentimorously, \"no one with such murderous desires should belong to ourparty, I\\'m sure. \"\"You see, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy, reprovingly, \"you are makingyourself disliked. There are certain things proper for a kitten to eat; but I never heard of a kitten eating a pig, under _any_ cir\\'stances. \"\"Did you ever see such little pigs before?\" asked the kitten. \"They areno bigger than mice, and I\\'m sure mice are proper for me to eat. \"\"It isn\\'t the bigness, dear; its the variety,\" replied the girl. \"Theseare Mr. Wizard\\'s pets, just as you are my pet, and it wouldn\\'t be anymore proper for you to eat them than it would be for Jim to eat you. And that\\'s just what I shall do if you don\\'t let those little balls ofpork alone,\" said Jim, glaring at the kitten with his round, big eyes. \"If you injure any one of them I\\'ll chew you up instantly. \"The kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully, as if trying to decidewhether he meant it or not. \"In that case,\" she said, \"I\\'ll leave them alone. You haven\\'t many teethleft, Jim, but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder. \"\"That is right, Eureka,\" remarked the Wizard, earnestly. \"Let us all bea happy family and love one another. \"I\\'ve always loved the piglets,\" she said; \"but they don\\'t love me. \"\"No one can love a person he\\'s afraid of,\" asserted Dorothy. \"If youbehave, and don\\'t scare the little pigs, I\\'m sure they\\'ll grow very fondof you. \"The Wizard now put the nine tiny ones back into his pocket and thejourney was resumed. \"We must be pretty near the top, now,\" said the boy, as they climbedwearily up the dark, winding stairway. \"The Country of the Gurgles can\\'t be far from the top of the earth,\"remarked Dorothy. \"It isn\\'t very nice down here. I\\'d like to get homeagain, I\\'m sure. \"No one replied to this, because they found they needed all their breathfor the climb. The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizardoften had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another, or keepit from jamming against the rocky walls. \"Thank goodness we\\'re nearly there!\" panted the little Wizard. Jim, who was in advance, saw the last stair before him and stuck hishead above the rocky sides of the stairway. \"Let\\'s go down again!\" he said, in his hoarse voice. \"What\\'s the matter with you, oldman? \"\"Everything,\" grumbled the horse. Everything\\'s dead, upthere--no flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere. \"\"Never mind; we can\\'t turn back,\" said Dorothy; \"and we don\\'t intend tostay there, anyhow. \"See here, my good steed,\" broke in the Wizard, \"little Dorothy and Ihave been in many queer countries in our travels, and always escapedwithout harm. We\\'ve even been to the marvelous Land of Oz--haven\\'t we,Dorothy?--so we don\\'t much care what the Country of the Gargoyles islike. Go ahead, Jim, and whatever happens we\\'ll make the best of it. \"\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"this is your excursion, and not mine;so if you get into trouble don\\'t blame me. \"The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden!\" exclaimed Zeb; and so itwas. There were odd woodenhouses, with carved wooden flowers in the front yards. Thepatches of grass were splinters of wood, and where neither grass norsawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring. Wooden birds flutteredamong the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass; butthe most amazing things of all were the wooden people--the creaturesknown as Gargoyles. Their bodies were round, their legs short and thick and theirarms extraordinarily long and stout. Their heads were too big for theirbodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon. Some had long,curved noses and chins, small eyes and wide, grinning mouths. Others hadflat noses, protruding eyes, and ears that were shaped like those of anelephant. The tops of their heads hadno hair, but were carved into a variety of fantastic shapes, some havinga row of points or balls around the top, other designs resemblingflowers or vegetables, and still others having squares that looked likewaffles cut criss-cross on their heads. They all wore short wooden wingswhich were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hingeswith wooden screws, and with these wings they flew swiftly andnoiselessly here and there, their legs being of little use to them. They made no sounds at all, either in flying or trying tospeak, and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made withtheir wooden fingers or lips. Neither was there any sound to be heardanywhere throughout the wooden country. The birds did not sing, nor didthe cows moo; yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere. Inturn the Wizard and the children, the horse and the kitten, examined theGargoyles with the same silent attention. \"There\\'s going to be trouble, I\\'m sure,\" remarked the horse. \"Unhitchthose tugs, Zeb, and set me free from the buggy, so I can fightcomfortably. \"\"Jim\\'s right,\" sighed the Wizard. \"There\\'s going to be trouble, and mysword isn\\'t stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies--so I shall haveto get out my revolvers. \"What harm can the Gurgles do?\" asked Dorothy. \"They have no weapons tohurt us with. \"\"Each of their arms is a wooden club,\" answered the little man, \"and I\\'msure the creatures mean mischief, by the looks of their eyes. Even theserevolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies,and after that we will be at their mercy. \"\"But why fight at all, in that case?\" asked the girl. \"So I may die with a clear conscience,\" returned the Wizard, gravely. \"It\\'s every man\\'s duty to do the best he knows how; and I\\'m going to doit. \"\"Wish I had an axe,\" said Zeb, who by now had unhitched the horse. The horse hadespecially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest andstrangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of theirfirst attack. Crack! crash! went his iron-shod hoofs against the wooden bodies of theGargoyles, and they were battered right and left with such force thatthey scattered like straws in the wind. The others picked themselves up fromthe ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows, so for amoment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease. \"Those wooden things are impossible to hurt,\" he said, \"and all thedamage Jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their nosesand ears. That cannot make them look any uglier, I\\'m sure, and it is myopinion they will soon renew the attack. \"\"What made them fly away?\" asked Dorothy. \"The noise, of course. Don\\'t you remember how the Champion escaped themby shouting his battle-cry?\"\"Suppose we escape down the stairs, too,\" suggested the boy. \"We havetime, just now, and I\\'d rather face the invis\\'ble bears than thosewooden imps. \"\"No,\" returned Dorothy, stoutly, \"it won\\'t do to go back, for then wewould never get home. Let\\'s fight it out. \"\"That is what I advise,\" said the Wizard. \"They haven\\'t defeated us yet,and Jim is worth a whole army. \"But the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the nexttime. The Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of hisenemies, and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silentplace. Some of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground, where they quiveredand trembled in every limb; but most of them managed to wheel and escapeagain to a distance. Zeb ran and picked up one of the Gargoyles that lay nearest to him. Thetop of its head was carved into a crown and the Wizard\\'s bullet hadstruck it exactly in the left eye, which was a hard wooden knot. Before this crowned Gargoyle had recoveredhimself Zeb had wound a strap several times around its body, confiningits wings and arms so that it could not move. Then, having tied thewooden creature securely, the boy buckled the strap and tossed hisprisoner into the buggy. By that time the others had all retired. [Illustration]CHAPTER 12. A WONDERFUL ESCAPEFor a while the enemy hesitated to renew the attack. \"That\\'s fine ,\" said Zeb. \"We\\'ve got \\'em on the run now, sure enough. \"\"But only for a time,\" replied the Wizard, shaking his head gloomily. \"These revolvers are good for six shots each, but when those are gone weshall be helpless. \"The Gargoyles seemed to realize this, for they sent a few of their bandtime after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from thelittle man\\'s revolvers. [Illustration: THE WIZARD FIRED INTO THE THRONG.]\"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously. \"Let\\'s yell--all together,\" said Zeb. \"And fight at the same time,\" added the Wizard. \"We will get near Jim,so that he can help us, and each one must take some weapon and do thebest he can. I\\'ll use my sword, although it isn\\'t much account in thisaffair. Dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when thewooden folks attack her. I haven\\'t anything for you, Zeb. \"\"I\\'ll use the king,\" said the boy, and pulled his prisoner out of thebuggy. The boywas strong for one of his years, having always worked upon a farm; so hewas likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard. Even the kitten gave a dreadfullyshrill scream and at the same time Jim the cab-horse neighed loudly. Perceiving this, as well as the fact that there were no more ofthe awful \"bangs\" to come from the revolvers, the Gargoyles advanced ina swarm as thick as bees, so that the air was filled with them. Dorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol, which nearlycovered her and proved a great protection. The Wizard\\'s sword-bladesnapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against thewooden people. The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even Eurekaassisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched and bitat them like a wild-cat. The wooden things woundtheir long arms around Zeb and the Wizard and held them fast. Dorothywas captured in the same way, and numbers of the Gargoyles clung toJim\\'s legs, so weighting him down that the poor beast was helpless. All of them expected nothing less than instant death; but to theirsurprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore themfar away, over miles and miles of wooden country, until they came to awooden city. They were tower-like in shape and the best ofthem seemed old and weather-worn; yet all were strong and substantial. The Gargoyles roughly pushed them into the opening, wherethere was a platform, and then flew away and left them. As they had nowings the strangers could not fly away, and if they jumped down fromsuch a height they would surely be killed. The creatures had senseenough to reason that way, and the only mistake they made was insupposing the earth people were unable to overcome such ordinarydifficulties. Jim was brought with the others, although it took a good many Gargoylesto carry the big beast through the air and land him on the highplatform, and the buggy was thrust in after him because it belonged tothe party and the wooden folks had no idea what it was used for orwhether it was alive or not. When Eureka\\'s captor had thrown the kittenafter the others the last Gargoyle silently disappeared, leaving ourfriends to breathe freely once more. \"What an awful fight!\" said Dorothy, catching her breath in littlegasps. \"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" purred Eureka, smoothing her ruffled fur with herpaw; \"we didn\\'t manage to hurt anybody, and nobody managed to hurt us. \"\"Thank goodness we are together again, even if we are prisoners,\" sighedthe little girl. \"I wonder why they didn\\'t kill us on the spot,\" remarked Zeb, who hadlost his king in the struggle. \"They are probably keeping us for some ceremony,\" the Wizard answered,reflectively; \"but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead aspossible in a short time. \"\"As dead as poss\\'ble would be pretty dead, wouldn\\'t it?\" asked Dorothy. \"Yes, my dear. But we have no need to worry about that just now. Let usexamine our prison and see what it is like. From their platform a stair descended into the house, and the childrenand the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them theway. Had therebeen any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards ofthe house been so thick and stout, escape would have been easy; but toremain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship, andthey did not like the darkness or the damp smell. Looking out, they could see into some of thehouses near them, where there were open windows in abundance, and wereable to mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in theirdwellings. \"This seems to be their time of rest,\" observed the Wizard. \"\"I feel sleepy myself,\" remarked Zeb, yawning. \"Why, where\\'s Eureka?\" cried Dorothy, suddenly. They all looked around, but the kitten was no place to be seen. \"She\\'s gone out for a walk,\" said Jim, gruffly. On the roof?\" asked the girl. \"\"She couldn\\'t climb _down_, Jim,\" said Dorothy. \"To climb means to goup. \"\"Who said so?\" demanded the horse. \"My school-teacher said so; and she knows a lot, Jim. \"\"To \\'climb down\\' is sometimes used as a figure of speech,\" remarked theWizard. \"Well, this was a figure of a cat,\" said Jim, \"and she _went_ down,anyhow, whether she climbed or crept. \"\"Dear me! how careless Eureka is,\" exclaimed the girl, much distressed. \"The Gurgles will get her, sure! \"\"Ha, ha!\" chuckled the old cab-horse; \"they\\'re not \\'Gurgles,\\' littlemaid; they\\'re Gargoyles. \"\"Never mind; they\\'ll get Eureka, whatever they\\'re called. \"\"No they won\\'t,\" said the voice of the kitten, and Eureka herselfcrawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon thefloor. asked Dorothy, sternly. \"Watching the wooden folks. They\\'re too funny for anything, Dorothy. Just now they are all going to bed, and--what do you think?--they unhookthe hinges of their wings and put them in a corner until they wake upagain. \"\"No; the wings. \"\"That,\" said Zeb, \"explains why this house is used by them for a prison. If any of the Gargoyles act badly, and have to be put in jail, they arebrought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them untilthey promise to be good. \"The Wizard had listened intently to what Eureka had said. \"I wish we had some of those loose wings,\" he said. \"Could we fly with them?\" asked Dorothy. \"I think so. If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to flylies in the wings themselves, and not in the wooden bodies of the peoplewho wear them. So, if we had the wings, we could probably fly as well asthey do--at least while we are in their country and under the spell ofits magic. \"\"But how would it help us to be able to fly?\" questioned the girl. \"Come here,\" said the little man, and took her to one of the corners ofthe building. \"Yes; it\\'s a good way off, but I can see it,\" she replied. I\\'ll get my spy-glass, and then you can see itmore plainly. \"He fetched a small but powerful telescope, which had been in hissatchel, and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening. \"Where does it lead to?\" she asked. \"That I cannot tell,\" said the Wizard; \"but we cannot now be far belowthe earth\\'s surface, and that entrance may lead to another stairway thatwill bring us on top of our world again, where we belong. So, if we hadthe wings, and could escape the Gargoyles, we might fly to that rock andbe saved. \"\"I\\'ll get you the wings,\" said Zeb, who had thoughtfully listened to allthis. \"That is, if the kitten will show me where they are. \"\"But how can you get down?\" enquired the girl, wonderingly. [Illustration: THE FIGHT WITH THE GARGOYLES.]\"I can climb down that, all right,\" he said. \"No you can\\'t,\" remarked Jim, with a twinkle in his round eyes. \"You may_go_ down, but you can only _climb_ up.\"\"Well, I\\'ll climb up when I get back, then,\" said the boy, with a laugh. \"Now, Eureka, you\\'ll have to show me the way to those wings. \"\"You must be very quiet,\" warned the kitten; \"for if you make the leastnoise the Gargoyles will wake up. \"\"I\\'m not going to drop a pin,\" said Zeb. He had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy, and now helet the line dangle over the side of the house. \"Be careful,\" cautioned Dorothy, earnestly. \"I will,\" said the boy, and let himself slide over the edge. The girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his waycarefully downward, hand over hand, until he stood upon the groundbelow. Eureka clung with her claws to the wooden side of the house andlet herself down easily. Then together they crept away to enter the lowdoorway of a neighboring dwelling. The watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again appeared,his arms now full of the wooden wings. When he came to where the strap was hanging he tied the wings all in abunch to the end of the line, and the Wizard drew them up. Then the linewas let down again for Zeb to climb up by. Eureka quickly followed him,and soon they were all standing together upon the platform, with eightof the much prized wooden wings beside them. The boy was no longer sleepy, but full of energy and excitement. Then, with theWizard\\'s help, he tried to fasten some of the wings to the oldcab-horse. This was no easy task, because half of each one of the hinges of thewings was missing, it being still fastened to the body of the Gargoylewho had used it. The other four wings were then fastened to the buggy, two on each side,for the buggy must bear the weight of the children and the Wizard as itflew through the air. [Illustration: JIM FLUTTERED AND FLOUNDERED THROUGH THE AIR.] These preparations had not consumed a great deal of time, but thesleeping Gargoyles were beginning to wake up and move around, and soonsome of them would be hunting for their missing wings. They mounted into the buggy, Dorothy holding Eureka safe in her lap. Thegirl sat in the middle of the seat, with Zeb and the Wizard on each sideof her. When all was ready the boy shook the reins and said:\"Fly away, Jim!\"\"Which wings must I flop first?\" asked the cab-horse, undecidedly. \"Flop them all together,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Some of them are crooked,\" objected the horse. \"Never mind; we will steer with the wings on the buggy,\" said Zeb. \"Justyou light out and make for that rock, Jim; and don\\'t waste any timeabout it, either.\"So the horse gave a groan, flopped its four wings all together, and flewaway from the platform. Dorothy was a little anxious about the successof their trip, for the way Jim arched his long neck and spread out hisbony legs as he fluttered and floundered through the air was enough tomake anybody nervous. He groaned, too, as if frightened, and the wingscreaked dreadfully because the Wizard had forgotten to oil them; butthey kept fairly good time with the wings of the buggy, so that theymade excellent progress from the start. Some of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, and lost no time incollecting a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when Dorothyhappened to look back she saw them coming in a great cloud that almostdarkened the sky. [Illustration]CHAPTER 13. THE DEN OF THE DRAGONETTESOur friends had a good start and were able to maintain it, for withtheir eight wings they could go just as fast as could the Gargoyles. Allthe way to the great rock the wooden people followed them, and when Jimfinally alighted at the mouth of the cavern the pursuers were still somedistance away. \"But, I\\'m afraid they\\'ll catch us yet,\" said Dorothy, greatly excited. \"No; we must stop them,\" declared the Wizard. \"Quick Zeb, help me pulloff these wooden wings!\" They tore off the wings, for which they had no further use, and theWizard piled them in a heap just outside the entrance to the cavern. The flames leaped up at once and the bonfire began to smoke and roar andcrackle just as the great army of wooden Gargoyles arrived. Thecreatures drew back at once, being filled with fear and horror; for sucha dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all thehistory of their wooden land. Inside the archway were several doors, leading to different rooms builtinto the mountain, and Zeb and the Wizard lifted these wooden doors fromtheir hinges and tossed them all on the flames. \"That will prove a barrier for some time to come,\" said the little man,smiling pleasantly all over his wrinkled face at the success of theirstratagem. \"Perhaps the flames will set fire to all that miserablewooden country, and if it does the loss will be very small and theGargoyles never will be missed. Asort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way, and they found the floorof it both rough and steep. This delayed and bothered themfor a while, because they did not wish to leave the buggy behind them. In this position theymanaged, with the aid of the patient cab-horse, to drag the vehiclethrough the narrow part of the passage. \"Anyhow,\" said Dorothy, \"we\\'ve \\'scaped those awful Gurgles, and that\\'s_one_ comfort! \"[Illustration: \"WHY IT\\'S A DRAGON!\"]\"Probably the Gargoyles are still busy trying to put out the fire,\"returned the Wizard. \"But even if they succeeded in doing that itwould be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks; so I amsure we need fear them no longer. Sometimes they had to climb over heaps of looserock, where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy. At such times Dorothy,Zeb and the Wizard all pushed behind, and lifted the wheels over theroughest places; so they managed, by dint of hard work, to keep going. \"What sort of a place is this?\" asked the boy, trying to see moreclearly through the gloom. \"I cannot imagine, I\\'m sure,\" answered the Wizard, also peering about. Don\\'t you see their terrible eyes? \"\"Eureka sees better in the dark than we can,\" whispered Dorothy. \"Tellus, dear, what do the creatures look like?\" she asked, addressing herpet. \"I simply can\\'t describe \\'em,\" answered the kitten, shuddering. \"Theireyes are like pie-plates and their mouths like coal-scuttles. But theirbodies don\\'t seem very big. \"\"Where are they?\" enquired the girl. \"They are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern. Oh,Dorothy--you can\\'t imagine what horrid things they are! \"\"Tut-tut! be careful how you criticise your neighbors,\" spoke a raspingvoice near by. \"As a matter of fact you are rather ugly-lookingcreatures yourselves, and I\\'m sure mother has often told us we were theloveliest and prettiest things in all the world. he exclaimed. \"No,\" answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking atthem so steadily; \"you are wrong about that. We hope to grow to bedragons some day, but just now we\\'re only dragonettes. \"\"What\\'s that?\" asked Dorothy, gazing fearfully at the great scaley head,the yawning mouth and the big eyes. \"Young dragons, of course; but we are not allowed to call ourselves realdragons until we get our full growth,\" was the reply. \"The big dragonsare very proud, and don\\'t think children amount to much; but mother saysthat some day we will all be very powerful and important. \"\"Where is your mother?\" asked the Wizard, anxiously looking around. If shehas good luck she will bring us an elephant, or a brace of rhinoceri, orperhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger. \"\"Oh; are you hungry?\" enquired Dorothy, drawing back. \"Very,\" said the dragonette, snapping its jaws. \"And--and--do you eat people? \"\"To be sure, when we can get them. But they\\'ve been very scarce for afew years and we usually have to be content with elephants orbuffaloes,\" answered the creature, in a regretful tone. \"How old are you?\" enquired Zeb, who stared at the yellow eyes as iffascinated. \"Quite young, I grieve to say; and all of my brothers and sisters thatyou see here are practically my own age. If I remember rightly, we weresixty-six years old the day before yesterday. \"\"But that isn\\'t young!\" cried Dorothy, in amazement. \"\"How old is your mother?\" asked the girl. She\\'s a littlefussy, you know, and afraid of growing old, being a widow and still inher prime. \"\"I should think she would be,\" agreed Dorothy. Then, after a moment\\'sthought, she asked: \"Are we friends or enemies? I mean, will you be goodto us, or do you intend to eat us? \"\"As for that, we dragonettes would love to eat you, my child; butunfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the backof our individual caves, so that we can not crawl out to get you. If youchoose to come nearer we will make a mouthful of you in a wink; butunless you do you will remain quite safe. \"There was a regretful accent in the creature\\'s voice, and at the wordsall the other dragonettes sighed dismally. Dorothy felt relieved. Presently she asked:\"Why did your mother tie your tails?\"\"Oh, she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips, andif we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight witheach other and get into a lot of mischief. Mother usually knows what sheis about, but she made a mistake this time; for you are sure to escapeus unless you come too near, and you probably won\\'t do that. \"\"No, indeed!\" said the little girl. \"We don\\'t wish to be eaten by suchawful beasts. \"\"Permit me to say,\" returned the dragonette, \"that you are ratherimpolite to call us names, knowing that we cannot resent your insults. And we are of an excellent family and have apedigree that I challenge any humans to equal, as it extends back abouttwenty thousand years, to the time of the famous Green Dragon ofAtlantis, who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created. Canyou match that pedigree, little girl?\"\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I was born on a farm in Kansas, and I guessthat\\'s being just as \\'spectable and haughty as living in a cave withyour tail tied to a rock. If it isn\\'t I\\'ll have to stand it, that\\'sall. \"\"Tastes differ,\" murmured the dragonette, slowly drooping its scaleyeyelids over its yellow eyes, until they looked like half-moons. Their front legs, which grew just back of theirheads, were also strong and big; but their bodies were smaller aroundthan their heads, and dwindled away in a long line until their tailswere slim as a shoe-string. Dorothy thought, if it had taken themsixty-six years to grow to this size, that it would be fully a hundredyears more before they could hope to call themselves dragons, and thatseemed like a good while to wait to grow up. \"It occurs to me,\" said the Wizard, \"that we ought to get out of thisplace before the mother dragon comes back. \"\"Don\\'t hurry,\" called one of the dragonettes; \"mother will be glad tomeet you, I\\'m sure. \"\"You may be right,\" replied the Wizard, \"but we\\'re a little particularabout associating with strangers. Will you kindly tell us which way yourmother went to get on top the earth? \"\"That is not a fair question to ask us,\" declared another dragonette. \"\"Then,\" decided Dorothy, \"we must find our way out the best we can. [Illustration]Chapter 14. OZMA USES THE MAGIC BELTFor a considerable distance the way led straight upward in a gentleincline, and the wanderers made such good progress that they grewhopeful and eager, thinking they might see sunshine at any minute. Jim the cab-horse came last, and the rocky wall almost caught him; forjust as he leaped to the floor of the further passage the wall swungacross it and a loose stone that the buggy wheels knocked against fellinto the narrow crack where the rock turned, and became wedged there. \"Never mind,\" said Zeb, \"we don\\'t want to get back, anyhow. \"\"I\\'m not so sure of that,\" returned Dorothy. \"The mother dragon may comedown and catch us here. \"\"Then we\\'re all right,\" said the girl, \"for if the dragon went the otherway she can\\'t poss\\'bly get to us now. \"\"Of course not, my dear. But there is another thing to consider. Themother dragon probably knows the road to the earth\\'s surface, and if shewent the other way then we have come the wrong way,\" said the Wizard,thoughtfully. \"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy. \"That would be unlucky, wouldn\\'t it?\"\"Very. Unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth,\" saidZeb. \"For my part, if we manage to get out of here I\\'ll be glad it isn\\'tthe way the dragon goes. \"\"So will I,\" returned Dorothy. Thelanterns were beginning to grow dim, and the Wizard poured the remainingoil from one into the other, so that the one light would last longer. They did not realize their ill fortune at first, for their hearts weregladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crackin the roof of the cave, far overhead. That meant that their world--thereal world--was not very far away, and that the succession of perilousadventures they had encountered had at last brought them near theearth\\'s surface, which meant home to them. \"But we\\'re _almost_ on earth again,\" cried Dorothy, \"for there is thesun--the most _beau\\'ful_ sun that shines!\" and she pointed eagerly atthe crack in the distant roof. \"Almost on earth isn\\'t being there,\" said the kitten, in a discontentedtone. \"It wouldn\\'t be possible for even me to get up to that crack--orthrough it if I got there. \"\"It appears that the path ends here,\" announced the Wizard, gloomily. \"And there is no way to go back,\" added Zeb, with a low whistle ofperplexity. \"I was sure it would come to this, in the end,\" remarked the oldcab-horse. And the wholething has been unnatural because that cat and I are both able to talkyour language, and to understand the words you say. \"\"And so can the nine tiny piglets,\" added Eureka. \"Don\\'t forget them,for I may have to eat them, after all. \"\"I\\'ve heard animals talk before,\" said Dorothy, \"and no harm came ofit. \"\"Were you ever before shut up in a cave, far under the earth, with noway of getting out?\" enquired the horse, seriously. \"No,\" answered Dorothy. \"But don\\'t you lose heart, Jim, for I\\'m surethis isn\\'t the end of our story, by any means. \"My dears,\" he said to them, \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ve got you into a lot oftrouble, and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomycave. \"\"What\\'s wrong?\" asked a piglet. \"We\\'ve been in the dark quite a while,and you may as well explain what has happened. \"Well,\" said another piglet, \"you are a wizard, are you not? \"\"I am,\" replied the little man. \"Then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole,\" declared thetiny one, with much confidence. \"I could if I happened to be a real wizard,\" returned the master sadly. \"\"Nonsense!\" cried several of the piglets, together. \"You can ask Dorothy,\" said the little man, in an injured tone. \"It\\'s true enough,\" returned the girl, earnestly. \"Our friend Oz ismerely a humbug wizard, for he once proved it to me. He can do severalvery wonderful things--if he knows how. But he can\\'t wiz a single thingif he hasn\\'t the tools and machinery to work with. \"\"Thank you, my dear, for doing me justice,\" responded the Wizard,gratefully. \"To be accused of being a real wizard, when I\\'m not, is aslander I will not tamely submit to. \"\"I don\\'t believe we\\'ll realize anything, when it comes to that,\"remarked Dorothy, who had been deep in thought. \"But I\\'m not going toscatter my bones just yet, because I need them, and you prob\\'ly needyours, too. \"\"We are helpless to escape,\" sighed the Wizard. \"_We_ may be helpless,\" answered Dorothy, smiling at him, \"but there areothers who can do more than we can. Cheer up, friends. I\\'m sure Ozmawill help us. exclaimed the Wizard. \"\"The girl that rules the marvelous Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"\"For the second time?\" asked the Wizard, with great interest. \"Yes. \"\"I remember those shoes,\" said the little man, nodding. \"They oncebelonged to the Wicked Witch. \"But thesecond time I went to the Land of Oz I owned the Nome King\\'s Magic Belt,which is much more powerful than were the Silver Shoes. \"\"Where is that Magic Belt?\" enquired the Wizard, who had listened withgreat interest. \"Ozma has it; for its powers won\\'t work in a common, ordinary countrylike the United States. Anyone in a fairy country like the Land of Ozcan do anything with it; so I left it with my friend the Princess Ozma,who used it to wish me in Australia with Uncle Henry. asked Zeb, astonished at what he heard. \"Of course; in just a jiffy. And Ozma has an enchanted picture hangingin her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends maybe, at any time she chooses. All she has to do is to say: \\'I wonder whatSo-and-so is doing,\\' and at once the picture shows where her friend isand what the friend is doing. That\\'s _real_ magic, Mr. Wizard; isn\\'t it? Well, every day at four o\\'clock Ozma has promised to look at me in thatpicture, and if I am in need of help I am to make her a certain sign andshe will put on the Nome King\\'s Magic Belt and wish me to be with her inOz.\"\"Do you mean that Princess Ozma will see this cave in her enchantedpicture, and see all of us here, and what we are doing?\" demanded Zeb. \"Of course; when it is four o\\'clock,\" she replied, with a laugh at hisstartled expression. \"And when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the Land of Oz?\"continued the boy. \"That\\'s it, exactly; by means of the Magic Belt. \"\"Then,\" said the Wizard, \"you will be saved, little Dorothy; and I amvery glad of it. The rest of us will die much more cheerfully when weknow you have escaped our sad fate. \"\"_I_ won\\'t die cheerfully!\" protested the kitten. \"There\\'s nothingcheerful about dying that I could ever see, although they say a cat hasnine lives, and so must die nine times. \"\"Have you ever died yet?\" enquired the boy. \"No, and I\\'m not anxious to begin ,\" said Eureka. \"Don\\'t worry, dear,\" Dorothy exclaimed, \"I\\'ll hold you in my arms, andtake you with me. cried the nine tiny piglets, all in one breath. \"Perhaps I can,\" answered Dorothy. \"I\\'ll try. \"\"Couldn\\'t you manage to hold me in your arms?\" asked the cab-horse. Dorothy laughed. \"I\\'ll do better than that,\" she promised, \"for I can easily save youall, once I am myself in the Land of Oz.\"\"How?\" they asked. \"By using the Magic Belt. All I need do is to wish you with me, andthere you\\'ll be--safe in the royal palace! \"\"Good!\" cried Zeb. \"I built that palace, and the Emerald City, too,\" remarked the Wizard,in a thoughtful tone, \"and I\\'d like to see them again, for I was veryhappy among the Munchkins and Winkies and Quadlings and Gillikins. \"\"Who are they?\" asked the boy. \"The four nations that inhabit the Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"\"Of course they would!\" declared Dorothy. \"\"Do you happen to know whatever became of the Tin Woodman and theScarecrow?\" he enquired. \"They live in Oz yet,\" said the girl, \"and are very important people. \"\"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t know the Hungry Tiger and Billina,\" said the Wizard,shaking his head. \"Is Billina a girl? \"\"No; she\\'s a yellow hen, and a great friend of mine. You\\'re sure to likeBillina, when you know her,\" asserted Dorothy. \"Your friends sound like a menagerie,\" remarked Zeb, uneasily. \"Couldn\\'t you wish me in some safer place than Oz.\"\"Don\\'t worry,\" replied the girl. \"You\\'ll just love the folks in Oz, whenyou get acquainted. What time is it, Mr. Wizard?\"The little man looked at his watch--a big silver one that he carried inhis vest pocket. \"Half-past three,\" he said. Then Jim suddenly asked:\"Are there any horses in Oz?\"\"Only one,\" replied Dorothy, \"and he\\'s a sawhorse. Princess Ozma once brought him to life with a witch-powder,when she was a boy. \"\"Was Ozma once a boy?\" asked Zeb, wonderingly. \"Yes; a wicked witch enchanted her, so she could not rule her kingdom. But she\\'s a girl now, and the sweetest, loveliest girl in all theworld. \"\"A sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on,\" remarked Jim, with a sniff. \"It is when it\\'s not alive,\" acknowledged the girl. I\\'ll race the miserable wooden donkey any day in the week!\" criedthe cab-horse. Dorothy did not reply to that. She felt that Jim would know more aboutthe Saw-Horse later on. The time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers, but finally theWizard announced that four o\\'clock had arrived, and Dorothy caught upthe kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to thefar-away, invisible Ozma. \"Nothing seems to happen,\" said Zeb, doubtfully. \"Oh, we must give Ozma time to put on the Magic Belt,\" replied the girl. She had scarcely spoken the words when she suddenly disappeared from thecave, and with her went the kitten. One moment Dorothy sat beside them with the kitten inher lap, and a moment later the horse, the piglets, the Wizard and theboy were all that remained in the underground prison. [Illustration: DOROTHY MADE THE SIGNAL.]\"I believe we will soon follow her,\" announced the Wizard, in a tone ofgreat relief; \"for I know something about the magic of the fairylandthat is called the Land of Oz. Let us be ready, for we may be sent forany minute. \"He put the piglets safely away in his pocket again and then he and Zebgot into the buggy and sat expectantly upon the seat. \"Will it hurt?\" asked the boy, in a voice that trembled a little. \"Not at all,\" replied the Wizard. \"It will all happen as quick as awink. \"And that was the way it did happen. The cab-horse gave a nervous start and Zeb began to rub his eyes to makesure he was not asleep. Zeb shook the reins to rouse the cab-horse from his stupor of amazement,for the people were beginning to gather around and stare at thestrangers. \"Gid-dap!\" cried the boy, and at the word Jim slowly trotted into thecourtyard and drew the buggy along the jewelled driveway to the greatentrance of the royal palace. [Illustration]CHAPTER 15. \"The little man looked at her closely and then took both the maiden\\'shands in his and shook them cordially. \"On my word,\" he exclaimed, \"it\\'s little Jellia Jamb--as pert and prettyas ever! \"\"Why not, Mr. Wizard?\" asked Jellia, bowing low. \"But I\\'m afraid youcannot rule the Emerald City, as you used to, because we now have abeautiful Princess whom everyone loves dearly. \"\"And the people will not willingly part with her,\" added a tall soldierin a Captain-General\\'s uniform. \"Did you not wear green whiskers at one time?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said the soldier; \"but I shaved them off long ago, and since thenI have risen from a private to be the Chief General of the RoyalArmies. \"\"That\\'s nice,\" said the little man. cried all the servants, and itpleased the Wizard to note the respect with which the royal retainersbowed before him. His fame had not been forgotten in the Land of Oz, byany means. \"Where is Dorothy?\" enquired Zeb, anxiously, as he left the buggy andstood beside his friend the little Wizard. \"She is with the Princess Ozma, in the private rooms of the palace,\"replied Jellia Jamb. The boy looked around him with wondering eyes. \"What\\'s to become of me?\" asked the horse, uneasily. He had seenconsiderable of life in the cities in his younger days, and knew thatthis regal palace was no place for him. It perplexed even Jellia Jamb, for a time, to know what to do with theanimal. The green maiden was much astonished at the sight of so unusuala creature, for horses were unknown in this Land; but those who lived inthe Emerald City were apt to be astonished by queer sights, so afterinspecting the cab-horse and noting the mild look in his big eyes thegirl decided not to be afraid of him. \"There are no stables here,\" said the Wizard, \"unless some have beenbuilt since I went away. \"\"We have never needed them before,\" answered Jellia; \"for the Sawhorselives in a room of the palace, being much smaller and more natural inappearance than this great beast you have brought with you. \"\"Do you mean that I\\'m a freak?\" asked Jim, angrily. \"Oh, no,\" she hastened to say, \"there may be many more like you in theplace you came from, but in Oz any horse but a Sawhorse is unusual. \"This mollified Jim a little, and after some thought the green maidendecided to give the cab-horse a room in the palace, such a big buildinghaving many rooms that were seldom in use. So Zeb unharnessed Jim, and several of the servants then led the horsearound to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that hecould have all to himself. Then Jellia said to the Wizard:\"Your own room--which was back of the great Throne Room--has been vacantever since you left us. Would you like it again? \"\"Yes, indeed!\" returned the little man. \"It will seem like being at homeagain, for I lived in that room for many, many years. \"He knew the way to it, and a servant followed him, carrying his satchel. In the closets he discovered many fancy costumes of richvelvets and brocades, and one of the attendants told him to dresshimself in any of the clothes that pleased him and to be prepared todine with the Princess and Dorothy in an hour\\'s time. He was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence ofthe Princess; he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room moredainty and attractive than it was splendid. Here he found Dorothy seatedbeside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stoppedsuddenly with a gasp of admiration. But Dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friend\\'s hand, drawing himimpulsively toward the lovely Princess, who smiled most graciously uponher guest. Then the Wizard entered, and his presence relieved the boy\\'sembarrassment. The little man was clothed in black velvet, with manysparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast; but his bald head andwrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive. Ozma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built theEmerald City and united the Munchkins, Gillikins, Quadlings and Winkiesinto one people; so when they were all four seated at the dinner tablethe Princess said:\"Please tell me, Mr. Wizard, whether you called yourself Oz after thisgreat country, or whether you believe my country is called Oz after you. It is a matter that I have long wished to enquire about, because you areof a strange race and my own name is Ozma. No one, I am sure, is betterable to explain this mystery than you. \"\"That is true,\" answered the little Wizard; \"therefore it will give mepleasure to explain my connection with your country. In the first place,I must tell you that I was born in Omaha, and my father, who was apolitician, named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman HenkleEmmannuel Ambroise Diggs, Diggs being the last name because he couldthink of no more to go before it. When I grew up Ijust called myself O. Z., because the other initials were P-I-N-H-E-A-D;and that spelled \\'pinhead,\\' which was a reflection on my intelligence. \"\"Surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short,\" said Ozma,sympathetically. \"But didn\\'t you cut it almost too short?\"\"Perhaps so,\" replied the Wizard. \"When a young man I ran away from homeand joined a circus. \"\"What does that mean?\" asked the Princess. \"Throwing my voice into any object I pleased, to make it appear that theobject was speaking instead of me. \"One day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the desertsto this beautiful country. When the people saw me come from the sky theynaturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before me. Itold them I was a Wizard, and showed them some easy tricks that amazedthem; and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they calledme Oz. \"\"Now I begin to understand,\" said the Princess, smiling. So when Dorothywas first blown to this place by a cyclone I arranged to go away withher in a balloon; but the balloon escaped too soon and carried me backalone. After many adventures I reached Omaha, only to find that all myold friends were dead or had moved away. \"\"That is quite a history,\" said Ozma; \"but there is a little morehistory about the Land of Oz that you do not seem to understand--perhapsfor the reason that no one ever told it you. Many years before you camehere this Land was united under one Ruler, as it is now, and the Ruler\\'sname was always \\'Oz\\', which means in our language \\'Great and Good\\'; or,if the Ruler happened to be a woman, her name was always \\'Ozma.\\' Butonce upon a time four Witches leagued together to depose the king andrule the four parts of the kingdom themselves; so when the Ruler, mygrandfather, was hunting one day, one Wicked Witch named Mombi stole himand carried him away, keeping him a close prisoner. That was why the people were so glad to see you, and why theythought from your initials that you were their rightful ruler. \"\"But, at that time,\" said the Wizard, thoughtfully, \"there were two GoodWitches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land. \"\"Yes,\" replied Ozma, \"because a good Witch had conquered Mombi in theNorth and Glinda the Good had conquered the evil Witch in the South. ButMombi was still my grandfather\\'s jailor, and afterward my father\\'sjailor. When I was born she transformed me into a boy, hoping that noone would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess ofthe Land of Oz. But I escaped from her and am now the Ruler of mypeople. \"\"I am very glad of that,\" said the Wizard, \"and hope you will considerme one of your most faithful and devoted subjects. \"\"We owe a great deal to the Wonderful Wizard,\" continued the Princess,\"for it was you who built this splendid Emerald City. \"\"Your people built it,\" he answered. \"I only bossed the job, as we sayin Omaha. \"\"But you ruled it wisely and well for many years,\" said she, \"and madethe people proud of your magical art. So, as you are now too old towander abroad and work in a circus, I offer you a home here as long asyou live. You shall be the Official Wizard of my kingdom, and be treatedwith every respect and consideration. \"\"I accept your kind offer with gratitude, gracious Princess,\" the littleman said, in a soft voice, and they could all see that tear-drops werestanding in his keen old eyes. It meant a good deal to him to secure ahome like this. \"He\\'s only a humbug Wizard, though,\" said Dorothy, smiling at him. \"And that is the safest kind of a Wizard to have,\" replied Ozma,promptly. \"Oz can do some good tricks, humbug or no humbug,\" announced Zeb, whowas now feeling more at ease. \"He shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow,\" said the Princess. \"I havesent messengers to summon all of Dorothy\\'s old friends to meet her andgive her welcome, and they ought to arrive very soon, now. \"Indeed, the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow,to hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to seeher again. \"How are your brains?\" enquired the little humbug, as he grasped thesoft, stuffed hands of his old friend. \"Working finely,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"[Illustration: DOROTHY AND OZMA.]\"How long did you rule the Emerald City, after I left here?\" was thenext question. \"Quite awhile, until I was conquered by a girl named General Jinjur. Dorothy sprangforward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms, uttering at the sametime a glad cry. \"Oh, Billina!\" she said; \"how fat and sleek you\\'ve grown. \"\"Why shouldn\\'t I?\" asked the hen, in a sharp, clear voice. \"I live onthe fat of the land--don\\'t I, Ozma?\"\"You have everything you wish for,\" said the Princess. She nestled herself comfortably in Dorothy\\'slap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped up with asharp claw fiercely bared to strike Billina a blow. But the little girlgave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped down againwithout daring to scratch. \"How horrid of you, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy. \"Is that the way to treat myfriends? \"\"You have queer friends, seems to me,\" replied the kitten, in a surlytone. \"Seems to me the same way,\" said Billina, scornfully, \"if that beastlycat is one of them. said Dorothy, sternly. \"I won\\'t have any quarrelling in theLand of Oz, I can tell you! Everybody lives in peace here, and loveseverybody else; and unless you two, Billina and Eureka, make up and befriends, I\\'ll take my Magic Belt and wish you both home again,_immejitly_. So, there!\"They were both much frightened at the threat, and promised meekly to begood. But it was never noticed that they became very warm friends, forall of that. And now the Tin Woodman arrived, his body most beautifullynickle-plated, so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of theroom. The Tin Woodman loved Dorothy most tenderly, and welcomed with joythe return of the little old Wizard. \"Sir,\" said he to the latter, \"I never can thank you enough for theexcellent heart you once gave me. It has made me many friends, I assureyou, and it beats as kindly and lovingly today as it ever did. \"\"I\\'m glad to hear that,\" said the Wizard. \"I was afraid it would getmoldy in that tin body of yours. \"\"Not at all,\" returned Nick Chopper. But he becamenervous again when the next visitor was announced. ,\" said Princess Ozma, \"is my friend Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.,who assisted me one time when I was in great distress, and is now theDean of the Royal College of Athletic Science. \"\"Ah,\" said the Wizard; \"I\\'m pleased to meet so distinguished apersonage. \"\"H. M.,\" said the Woggle-Bug, pompously, \"means Highly Magnified; and T.E. means Thoroughly Educated. \"\"How well you disguise it,\" said the Wizard. \"But I don\\'t doubt yourword in the least. \"\"Nobody doubts it, sir,\" replied the Woggle-Bug, and drawing a book fromits pocket the strange insect turned its back on the company and satdown in a corner to read. [Illustration]CHAPTER 16. JIM, THE CAB-HORSEJim the Cab-horse found himself in possession of a large room with agreen marble floor and carved marble wainscoting, which was so statelyin its appearance that it would have awed anyone else. Then they told him dinner would be served directly and he replied thatthey could not serve it too quickly to suit his convenience. First theybrought him a steaming bowl of soup, which the horse eyed in dismay. \"Take that stuff away!\" \"Do you take me for asalamander?\"They obeyed at once, and next served a fine large turbot on a silverplatter, with drawn gravey poured over it. \"Fish!\" cried Jim, with a sniff. \"Do you take me for a tom-cat? Awaywith it! \"Well, well!\" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked. Is there nothing that is decent toeat in this palace? \"The trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward, who came in haste andsaid:\"What would your Highness like for dinner? \"\"Highness!\" repeated Jim, who was unused to such titles. \"You are at least six feet high, and that is higher than any otheranimal in this country,\" said the Steward. \"Well, my Highness would like some oats,\" declared the horse. We have no whole oats,\" the Steward replied, with muchdefference. \"But there is any quantity of oatmeal, which we often cookfor breakfast. Oatmeal is a breakfast dish,\" added the Steward, humbly. \"I\\'ll make it a dinner dish,\" said Jim. \"Fetch it on, but don\\'t cook it,as you value your life. \"You see, the respect shown the worn-out old cab-horse made him a littlearrogant, and he forgot he was a guest, never having been treatedotherwise than as a servant since the day he was born, until his arrivalin the Land of Oz. But the royal attendants did not heed the animal\\'sill temper. They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water, andJim ate it with much relish. Then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horseslept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life. The Sawhorse stopped atthe same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding eyes,which were mere knots in the log that formed its body. The ends of the wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold,and the saddle of the Princess Ozma, which was of red leather set withsparkling diamonds, was strapped to the clumsy body. Then Jim exclaimed:\"For goodness sake, what sort of a being are you?\"\"I\\'m a Sawhorse,\" replied the other. \"Oh; I believe I\\'ve heard of you,\" said the cab-horse; \"but you areunlike anything that I expected to see. But a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to bealive. \"\"I couldn\\'t help it,\" returned the other, rather crestfallen. \"Ozmasprinkled me with a magic powder, and I just had to live. I know I\\'m notmuch account; but I\\'m the only horse in all the Land of Oz, so \"\"You, a horse! \"\"Oh, not a real one, of course. There are no real horses here at all. But I\\'m a splendid imitation of one.\" he cried. \"Behold a real horse!\"The wooden animal gave a start, and then examined the other intently. \"Is it possible that you are a Real Horse?\" he murmured. \"Not only possible, but true,\" replied Jim, who was gratified by theimpression he had created. \"It is proved by my fine points. For example,look at the long hairs on my tail, with which I can whisk away theflies. \"\"The flies never trouble me,\" said the Saw-Horse. And notice my great strong teeth, with which I nibble the grass. \"\"It is not necessary for me to eat,\" observed the Saw-horse. \"Also examine my broad chest, which enables me to draw deep, fullbreaths,\" said Jim, proudly. \"I have no need to breathe,\" returned the other. \"No; you miss many pleasures,\" remarked the cab-horse, pityingly. You may be an imitation of a horse, butyou\\'re a mighty poor one. \"\"Oh, I cannot hope ever to be like you,\" sighed the Sawhorse. \"But I amglad to meet at last a Real Horse. You are certainly the most beautifulcreature I ever beheld. \"This praise won Jim completely. Said he:\"Your chief fault, my friend, is in being made of wood, and that Isuppose you cannot help. Real horses, like myself, are made of flesh andblood and bones. \"\"I can see the bones all right,\" replied the Sawhorse, \"and they areadmirable and distinct. Also I can see the flesh. But the blood, Isuppose, is tucked away inside. \"\"Exactly,\" said Jim. \"What good is it?\" asked the Sawhorse. Jim did not know, but he would not tell the Sawhorse that. \"If anything cuts me,\" he replied, \"the blood runs out to show where Iam cut. You, poor thing! cannot even bleed when you are hurt. \"\"But I am never hurt,\" said the Sawhorse. \"Once in a while I get brokenup some, but I am easily repaired and put in good order again. And Inever feel a break or a splinter in the least. \"Jim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to feelpain; but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided hewould not change places with it under any circumstances. \"How did you happen to be shod with gold?\" he asked. \"Princess Ozma did that,\" was the reply; \"and it saves my legs fromwearing out. We\\'ve had a good many adventures together, Ozma and I, andshe likes me. \"The cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and aneigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf. For around the cornerhad come two enormous savage beasts, treading so lightly that they wereupon him before he was aware of their presence. Jim was in the act ofplunging down the path to escape when the Sawhorse cried out:\"Stop, my brother! Stop, Real Horse! These are friends, and will do youno harm. \"Jim hesitated, eyeing the beasts fearfully. One was an enormous Lionwith clear, intelligent eyes, a tawney mane bushy and well kept, and abody like yellow plush. The other was a great Tiger with purple stripesaround his lithe body, powerful limbs, and eyes that showed through thehalf closed lids like coals of fire. The huge forms of these monarchs ofthe forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutestheart, and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them. But the Sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone, saying,\"This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiantKing of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of PrincessOzma. These royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy and have cometo the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our fairyland. He bowed his headwith as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage lookingbeasts, who in return nodded in a friendly way. \"Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal?\" asked the Sawhorseadmiringly. \"That is doubtless a matter of taste,\" returned the Lion. \"In the foresthe would be thought ungainly, because his face is stretched out and hisneck is uselessly long. His joints, I notice, are swollen and overgrown,and he lacks flesh and is old in years. \"\"And dreadfully tough,\" added the Hungry Tiger, in a sad voice. \"Myconscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the RealHorse. \"\"I\\'m glad of that,\" said Jim; \"for I, also, have a conscience, and ittells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof. The Tiger seemed to smile, and winked one eye slowly. \"You have a good conscience, friend Horse,\" it said, \"and if you attendto its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm. \"\"Any friend of Dorothy,\" remarked the Cowardly Lion, \"must be ourfriend, as well. So let us cease this talk of skull crushing andconverse upon more pleasant subjects. Have you breakfasted, Sir Horse?\"\"Not yet,\" replied Jim. \"But here is plenty of excellent clover, so ifyou will excuse me I will eat now. \"\"He\\'s a vegetarian,\" remarked the Tiger, as the horse began to munch theclover. \"If I could eat grass I would not need a conscience, for nothingcould then tempt me to devour babies and lambs. \"Just then Dorothy, who had risen early and heard the voices of theanimals, ran out to greet her old friends. By the time they had indulged in a good talk and Dorothy had told themall about the awful earthquake and her recent adventures, the breakfastbell rang from the palace and the little girl went inside to join herhuman comrades. As she entered the great hall a voice called out, in arather harsh tone:\"What! are _you_ here again? \"\"Yes, I am,\" she answered, looking all around to see where the voicecame from. \"What brought you back?\" was the next question, and Dorothy\\'s eye restedon an antlered head hanging on the wall just over the fireplace, andcaught its lips in the act of moving. \"Good gracious!\" she exclaimed. \"\"So I am,\" replied the head. \"But once on a time I was part of the Gump,which Ozma sprinkled with the Powder of Life. I was then for a time theHead of the finest Flying Machine that was ever known to exist, and wedid many wonderful things. Afterward the Gump was taken apart and I wasput back on this wall; but I can still talk when I feel in the mood,which is not often. \"\"It\\'s very strange,\" said the girl. \"\"That I have forgotten,\" replied the Gump\\'s Head, \"and I do not think itis of much importance. But here comes Ozma; so I\\'d better hush up, forthe Princess doesn\\'t like me to chatter since she changed her name fromTip to Ozma. \"Just then the girlish Ruler of Oz opened the door and greeted Dorothywith a good-morning kiss. The little Princess seemed fresh and rosy andin good spirits. \"Breakfast is served, dear,\" she said, \"and I am hungry. So don\\'t let uskeep it waiting a single minute. \"[Illustration][Illustration: JIM STOOD TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF.] CHAPTER 17. So first there was to be a grand procession through the streets, afterwhich the little old man was requested to perform some of his wizardriesin the great Throne Room of the palace. Just behind the royal standard-bearers came the Princess Ozma in herroyal chariot, which was of gold encrusted with emeralds and diamondsset in exquisite designs. The chariot was drawn on this occasion by theCowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, who were decorated with immense pinkand blue bows. In the chariot rode Ozma and Dorothy, the former insplendid raiment and wearing her royal coronet, while the little Kansasgirl wore around her waist the Magic Belt she had once captured from theNome King. Following the chariot came the Scarecrow mounted on the Sawhorse, andthe people cheered him almost as loudly as they did their lovely Ruler. Behind him stalked with regular, jerky steps, the famous machine-mancalled Tik-tok, who had been wound up by Dorothy for the occasion. Hereally belonged to the Kansas girl, who had much respect for histhoughts after they had been properly wound and set going; but as thecopper man would be useless in any place but a fairy country Dorothy hadleft him in charge of Ozma, who saw that he was suitably cared for. Jim and the buggy followed, the oldcab-horse being driven by Zeb while the Wizard stood up on the seat andbowed his bald head right and left in answer to the cheers of thepeople, who crowded thick about him. Taken altogether the procession was a grand success, and when it hadreturned to the palace the citizens crowded into the great Throne Roomto see the Wizard perform his tricks. The first thing the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white pigletfrom underneath his hat and pretend to pull it apart, making two. Thisact he repeated until all of the nine tiny piglets were visible, andthey were so glad to get out of his pocket that they ran around in avery lively manner. The pretty little creatures would have been anovelty anywhere, so the people were as amazed and delighted at theirappearance as even the Wizard could have desired. When he had made themall disappear again Ozma declared she was sorry they were gone, for she So the Wizard pretended to takeone of the piglets out of the hair of the Princess (while really heslyly took it from his inside pocket) and Ozma smiled joyously as thecreature nestled in her arms, and she promised to have an emerald collarmade for its fat neck and to keep the little squealer always at hand toamuse her. In his little room back of the Throne Room the Wizard had found a lot ofthings he had left behind him when he went away in the balloon, for noone had occupied the apartment in his absence. So he followed the trick of the nine tinypiglets with several other wonderful feats that greatly delighted hisaudience and the people did not seem to care a bit whether the littleman was a humbug Wizard or not, so long as he succeeded in amusing them. They applauded all his tricks and at the end of the performance beggedhim earnestly not to go away again and leave them. \"In that case,\" said the little man, gravely, \"I will cancel all of myengagements before the crowned heads of Europe and America and devotemyself to the people of Oz, for I love you all so well that I can denyyou nothing. \"After the people had been dismissed with this promise our friends joinedPrincess Ozma at an elaborate luncheon in the palace, where even theTiger and the Lion were sumptuously fed and Jim the Cab-horse ate hisoatmeal out of a golden bowl with seven rows of rubies, sapphires anddiamonds set around the rim of it. You may be sure the folks of Oz did their best with such adistinguished company watching them, and finally Zeb offered to wrestlewith a little Munchkin who seemed to be the champion. In appearance hewas twice as old as Zeb, for he had long pointed whiskers and wore apeaked hat with little bells all around the brim of it, which tinkledgaily as he moved. But although the Munchkin was hardly tall enough tocome to Zeb\\'s shoulder he was so strong and clever that he laid the boythree times on his back with apparent ease. Zeb was greatly astonished at his defeat, and when the pretty Princessjoined her people in laughing at him he proposed a boxing-match with theMunchkin, to which the little Ozite readily agreed. But the first timethat Zeb managed to give him a sharp box on the ears the Munchkin satdown upon the ground and cried until the tears ran down his whiskers,because he had been hurt. This made Zeb laugh, in turn, and the boyfelt comforted to find that Ozma laughed as merrily at her weepingsubject as she had at him. Just then the Scarecrow proposed a race between the Sawhorse and theCab-horse; and although all the others were delighted at the suggestionthe Sawhorse drew back, saying:\"Such a race would not be fair. \"\"Of course not,\" added Jim, with a touch of scorn; \"those little woodenlegs of yours are not half as long as my own. \"\"It isn\\'t that,\" said the Sawhorse, modestly; \"but I never tire, and youdo. \"\"Bah!\" cried Jim, looking with great disdain at the other; \"do youimagine for an instant that such a shabby imitation of a horse as youare can run as fast as I? \"\"I don\\'t know, I\\'m sure,\" replied the Sawhorse. \"That is what we are trying to find out,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"Theobject of a race is to see who can win it--or at least that is what myexcellent brains think. \"\"Once, when I was young,\" said Jim, \"I was a race horse, and defeatedall who dared run against me. I was born in Kentucky, you know, whereall the best and most aristocratic horses come from. \"\"But you\\'re old, now, Jim,\" suggested Zeb. \"Old! Why, I feel like a colt today,\" replied Jim. \"I only wish therewas a real horse here for me to race with. I\\'d show the people a finesight, I can tell you. \"\"Then why not race with the Sawhorse?\" enquired the Scarecrow. \"He\\'s afraid,\" said Jim. \"Oh, no,\" answered the Sawhorse. \"I merely said it wasn\\'t fair. But ifmy friend the Real Horse is willing to undertake the race I am quiteready. \"When I say \\'Go!\\'\" Zeb called to them, \"you must dig out and race untilyou reach those three trees you see over yonder. Then circle \\'round themand come back again. The first one that passes the place where thePrincess sits shall be named the winner. Are you ready?\"\"I suppose I ought to give the wooden dummy a good start of me,\" growledJim. \"Never mind that,\" said the Sawhorse. \"I\\'ll do the best I can. cried Zeb; and at the word the two horses leaped forward and therace was begun. [Illustration: THE WIZARD TOOK A PIGLET FROM OZMA\\'S HAIR.] Its wooden legsmoved so fast that their twinkling could scarcely be seen, andalthough so much smaller than the cab-horse it covered the ground muchfaster. Before they had reached the trees the Sawhorse was far ahead,and the wooden animal returned to the starting place and was beinglustily cheered by the Ozites before Jim came panting up to the canopywhere the Princess and her friends were seated. [Illustration: THE HUNGRY TIGER TEACHES JIM A LESSON.] The beast struckJim full on his shoulder and sent the astonished cab-horse rolling overand over, amid shouts of delight from the spectators, who had beenhorrified by the ungracious act he had been guilty of. When Jim came to himself and sat upon his haunches he found the CowardlyLion crouched on one side of him and the Hungry Tiger on the other, andtheir eyes were glowing like balls of fire. \"I beg your pardon, I\\'m sure,\" said Jim, meekly. \"I was wrong to kickthe Sawhorse, and I am sorry I became angry at him. He has won the race,and won it fairly; but what can a horse of flesh do against a tirelessbeast of wood? \"Hearing this apology the Tiger and the Lion stopped lashing their tailsand retreated with dignified steps to the side of the Princess. Then the Tin Woodman cut a straight and strong limb from a tree with hisgleaming axe and made a new leg and a new ear for the Sawhorse; and whenthey had been securely fastened in place Princess Ozma took the coronetfrom her own head and placed it upon that of the winner of the race. Said she:\"My friend, I reward you for your swiftness by proclaiming you Prince ofHorses, whether of wood or of flesh; and hereafter all other horses--inthe Land of Oz, at least--must be considered imitations, and you thereal Champion of your race. \"I ought to be a fairy,\" grumbled Jim, as he slowly drew the buggy home;\"for to be just an ordinary horse in a fairy country is to be of noaccount whatever. It\\'s no place for us, Zeb. \"\"It\\'s lucky we got here, though,\" said the boy; and Jim thought of thedark cave, and agreed with him. [Illustration]CHAPTER 18. THE TRIAL OF EUREKA THE KITTENSeveral days of festivity and merry-making followed, for such oldfriends did not often meet and there was much to be told and talked overbetween them, and many amusements to be enjoyed in this delightfulcountry. Ozma was happy to have Dorothy beside her, for girls of her own age withwhom it was proper for the Princess to associate were very few, andoften the youthful Ruler of Oz was lonely for lack of companionship. It was the third morning after Dorothy\\'s arrival, and she was sittingwith Ozma and their friends in a reception room, talking over old times,when the Princess said to her maid:\"Please go to my boudoir, Jellia, and get the white piglet I left on thedressing-table. \"The piglet is not there, your Highness,\" said she. \"Not there!\" exclaimed Ozma. \"Are you sure? \"\"I have hunted in every part of the room,\" the maid replied. \"Was not the door closed?\" asked the Princess. \"Yes, your Highness; I am sure it was; for when I opened it Dorothy\\'swhite kitten crept out and ran up the stairs. \"Hearing this, Dorothy and the Wizard exchanged startled glances, forthey remembered how often Eureka had longed to eat a piglet. The littlegirl jumped up at once. \"Come, Ozma,\" she said, anxiously; \"let us go ourselves to search forthe piglet. \"So the two went to the dressing-room of the Princess and searchedcarefully in every corner and among the vases and baskets and ornamentsthat stood about the pretty boudoir. But not a trace could they find ofthe tiny creature they sought. Dorothy was nearly weeping, by this time, while Ozma was angry andindignant. When they returned to the others the Princess said:\"There is little doubt that my pretty piglet has been eaten by thathorrid kitten, and if that is true the offender must be punished. \"\"I don\\'t b\\'lieve Eureka would do such a dreadful thing!\" cried Dorothy,much distressed. \"Go and get my kitten, please, Jellia, and we\\'ll hearwhat she has to say about it. \"The green maiden hastened away, but presently returned and said:\"The kitten will not come. She threatened to scratch my eyes out if Itouched her. \"\"Where is she?\" asked Dorothy. \"Under the bed in your own room,\" was the reply. So Dorothy ran to her room and found the kitten under the bed. \"Come here, Eureka!\" she said. \"I won\\'t,\" answered the kitten, in a surly voice. \"Oh, Eureka! Why are you so bad?\"The kitten did not reply. \"If you don\\'t come to me, right away,\" continued Dorothy, gettingprovoked, \"I\\'ll take my Magic Belt and wish you in the Country of theGurgles. \"\"Why do you want me?\" asked Eureka, disturbed by this threat. \"You must go to Princess Ozma. She wants to talk to you. \"\"All right,\" returned the kitten, creeping out. \"I\\'m not afraid ofOzma--or anyone else. \"Dorothy carried her in her arms back to where the others sat in grievedand thoughtful silence. \"Tell me, Eureka,\" said the Princess, gently: \"did you eat my prettypiglet? \"\"I won\\'t answer such a foolish question,\" asserted Eureka, with a snarl. \"Oh, yes you will, dear,\" Dorothy declared. So, if you areinnocent, Eureka, you must tell the Princess how you came to be in herroom, and what has become of the piglet. \"\"Who accuses me?\" asked the kitten, defiantly. \"No one,\" answered Ozma. The fact isthat I left my little pet in my dressing-room lying asleep upon thetable; and you must hove stolen in without my knowing it. \"\"That\\'s none of my business,\" growled the kitten. \"Don\\'t be impudent, Eureka,\" admonished Dorothy. \"It is you who are impudent,\" said Eureka, \"for accusing me of such acrime when you can\\'t prove it except by guessing. \"Ozma was now greatly incensed by the kitten\\'s conduct. She summoned herCaptain-General, and when the long, lean officer appeared she said:\"Carry this cat away to prison, and keep her in safe confinement untilshe is tried by law for the crime of murder.\"So the Captain-General took Eureka from the arms of the now weepingDorothy and in spite of the kitten\\'s snarls and scratches carried itaway to prison. \"What shall we do now?\" asked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, for such acrime had cast a gloom over all the company. \"I will summon the Court to meet in the Throne Room at three o\\'clock,\"replied Ozma. \"I myself will be the judge, and the kitten shall have afair trial. \"\"What will happen if she is guilty?\" asked Dorothy. \"She must die,\" answered the Princess. \"Nine times?\" enquired the Scarecrow. \"As many times as is necessary,\" was the reply. \"I will ask the TinWoodman to defend the prisoner, because he has such a kind heart I amsure he will do his best to save her. And the Woggle-Bug shall be thePublic Accuser, because he is so learned that no one can deceive him. \"\"Who will be the jury?\" asked the Tin Woodman. [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF THE WIZARD OF OZ.]\"There ought to be several animals on the jury,\" said Ozma, \"becauseanimals understand each other better than we people understand them. So the jury shall consist of the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, Jimthe Cab-horse, the Yellow Hen, the Scarecrow, the Wizard, Tik-tok theMachine Man, the Sawhorse and Zeb of Hugson\\'s Ranch. That makes the ninewhich the law requires, and all my people shall be admitted to hear thetestimony. But it must be stated that the people of that Landwere generally so well-behaved that there was not a single lawyeramongst them, and it had been years since any Ruler had sat in judgmentupon an offender of the law. The Wizard, when he returned to his own room, was exceedinglythoughtful. He had no doubt Eureka had eaten his piglet, but he realizedthat a kitten cannot be depended upon at all times to act properly,since its nature is to destroy small animals and even birds for food,and the tame cat that we keep in our houses today is descended from thewild cat of the jungle--a very ferocious creature, indeed. The Wizardknew that if Dorothy\\'s pet was found guilty and condemned to death thelittle girl would be made very unhappy; so, although he grieved over thepiglet\\'s sad fate as much as any of them, he resolved to save Eureka\\'slife. Sending for the Tin Woodman the Wizard took him into a corner andwhispered:\"My friend, it is your duty to defend the white kitten and try to saveher, but I fear you will fail because Eureka has long wished to eat apiglet, to my certain knowledge, and my opinion is that she has beenunable to resist the temptation. Yet her disgrace and death would notbring back the piglet, but only serve to make Dorothy unhappy. So Iintend to prove the kitten\\'s innocence by a trick. \"He drew from his inside pocket one of the eight tiny piglets that wereremaining and continued:\"This creature you must hide in some safe place, and if the jury decidesthat Eureka is guilty you may then produce this piglet and claim it isthe one that was lost. \"\"I do not like to deceive my friends,\" replied the Tin Woodman; \"still,my kind heart urges me to save Eureka\\'s life, and I can usually trust myheart to do the right thing. So I will do as you say, friend Wizard. CHAPTER 19. THE WIZARD PERFORMS ANOTHER TRICKAt three o\\'clock the Throne Room was crowded with citizens, men, womenand children being eager to witness the great trial. Princess Ozma, dressed in her most splendid robes of state, sat in themagnificent emerald throne, with her jewelled sceptre in her hand andher sparkling coronet upon her fair brow. At her right sat the queerly assorted Jury--animals, animateddummies and people--all gravely prepared to listen to what was said. Thekitten had been placed in a large cage just before the throne, where shesat upon her haunches and gazed through the bars at the crowds aroundher, with seeming unconcern. \"\"Do you mean my kitten must be put in a grave?\" asked Dorothy. \"Don\\'t interrupt, little girl ,\" said the Woggle-Bug. \"When I get mythoughts arranged in good order I do not like to have anything upsetthem or throw them into confusion. \"\"If your thoughts were any good they wouldn\\'t become confused,\" remarkedthe Scarecrow, earnestly. \"My thoughts are always----\"\"Is this a trial of thoughts, or of kittens?\" demanded the Woggle-Bug. \"It\\'s a trial of one kitten,\" replied the Scarecrow; \"but your manner isa trial to us all. \"\"The criminal who now sits before the court licking her paws,\" resumedthe Woggle-Bug, \"has long desired to unlawfully eat the fat piglet,which was no bigger than a mouse. I can see her, in my mind\\'seye----\"\"What\\'s that?\" asked the Scarecrow. \"I say I can see her in my mind\\'s eye----\"\"The mind has no eye,\" declared the Scarecrow. \"\"Your Highness,\" cried the Woggle-Bug, appealing to Ozma, \"have I amind\\'s eye, or haven\\'t I? \"\"If you have, it is invisible,\" said the Princess. \"Very true,\" returned the Woggle-Bug, bowing. \"I say I see the criminal,in my mind\\'s eye, creeping stealthily into the room of our Ozma andsecreting herself, when no one was looking, until the Princess had goneaway and the door was closed. Then the murderer was alone with herhelpless victim, the fat piglet, and I see her pounce upon the innocentcreature and eat it up----\"\"Are you still seeing with your mind\\'s eye?\" enquired the Scarecrow. \"Of course; how else could I see it? And we know the thing is true,because since the time of that interview there is no piglet to be foundanywhere. \"[Illustration: EUREKA IN COURT.]\"I suppose, if the cat had been gone, instead of the piglet, your mind\\'seye would see the piglet eating the cat,\" suggested the Scarecrow. Then the Princessspoke in a stern voice:\"Prisoner, what have you to say for yourself? Are you guilty, or notguilty?\"\"Why, that\\'s for you to find out,\" replied Eureka. \"If you can prove I\\'mguilty, I\\'ll be willing to die nine times, but a mind\\'s eye is no proof,because the Woggle-Bug has no mind to see with. \"\"Never mind, dear,\" said Dorothy. Then the Tin Woodman arose and said:\"Respected Jury and dearly beloved Ozma, I pray you not to judge thisfeline prisoner unfeelingly. I do not think the innocent kitten can beguilty, and surely it is unkind to accuse a luncheon of being a murder. Eureka is the sweet pet of a lovely little girl whom we all admire, andgentleness and innocence are her chief virtues. Look at the kitten\\'sintelligent eyes;\" (here Eureka closed her eyes sleepily) \"gaze at hersmiling countenance!\" (here Eureka snarled and showed her teeth) \"markthe tender pose of her soft, padded little hands!\" \"Would such agentle animal be guilty of eating a fellow creature? No; a thousandtimes, no!\"\"Oh, cut it short,\" said Eureka; \"you\\'ve talked long enough. \"\"I\\'m trying to defend you,\" remonstrated the Tin Woodman. \"Then say something sensible,\" retorted the kitten. \"Tell them it wouldbe foolish for me to eat the piglet, because I had sense enough to knowit would raise a row if I did. But don\\'t try to make out I\\'m tooinnocent to eat a fat piglet if I could do it and not be found out. Iimagine it would taste mighty good. \"\"Perhaps it would, to those who eat,\" remarked the Tin Woodman. \"Imyself, not being built to eat, have no personal experience in suchmatters. But I remember that our great poet once said:    \"\\'To eat is sweet    When hunger\\'s seat    Demands a treat    Of savory meat.\\' \"Take this into consideration, friends of the Jury, and you will readilydecide that the kitten is wrongfully accused and should be set atliberty. As for the Jury, the members whispered to each otherfor a few minutes and then they appointed the Hungry Tiger theirspokesman. The huge beast slowly arose and said:\"Kittens have no consciences, so they eat whatever pleases them. Thejury believes the white kitten known as Eureka is guilty of having eatenthe piglet owned by Princess Ozma, and recommends that she be put todeath in punishment of the crime. \"The judgment of the jury was received with great applause, althoughDorothy was sobbing miserably at the fate of her pet. The Princess wasjust about to order Eureka\\'s head chopped off with the Tin Woodman\\'s axewhen that brilliant personage once more arose and addressed her. \"Your Highness,\" said he, \"see how easy it is for a jury to be mistaken. The kitten could not have eaten your piglet--for here it is! \"He took off his funnel hat and from beneath it produced a tiny whitepiglet, which he held aloft that all might see it clearly. Ozma was delighted and exclaimed, eagerly:\"Give me my pet, Nick Chopper! \"And all the people cheered and clapped their hands, rejoicing that theprisoner had escaped death and been proved to be innocent. As the Princess held the white piglet in her arms and stroked its softhair she said: \"Let Eureka out of the cage, for she is no longer aprisoner, but our good friend. Where did you find my missing pet, NickChopper?\"\"In a room of the palace,\" he answered. \"Justice,\" remarked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, \"is a dangerous thing tomeddle with. If you hadn\\'t happened to find the piglet, Eureka wouldsurely have been executed. \"\"But justice prevailed at the last,\" said Ozma, \"for here is my pet, andEureka is once more free. \"\"I refuse to be free,\" cried the kitten, in a sharp voice, \"unless theWizard can do his trick with eight piglets. \"\"The piglet that belonged to the Princess wore an emerald collar,\" saidEureka, loudly enough for all to hear. \"So it did!\" exclaimed Ozma. \"\"Of course not; he had nine of them, altogether,\" declared Eureka; \"andI must say it was very stingy of him not to let me eat just a few. Butnow that this foolish trial is ended, I will tell you what really becameof your pet piglet. \"At this everyone in the Throne Room suddenly became quiet, and thekitten continued, in a calm, mocking tone of voice:\"I will confess that I intended to eat the little pig for my breakfast;so I crept into the room where it was kept while the Princess wasdressing and hid myself under a chair. When Ozma went away she closedthe door and left her pet on the table. Instead of keeping still, so I could eat him comfortably, he trembled sowith fear that he fell off the table into a big vase that was standingon the floor. The vase had a very small neck, and spread out at the toplike a bowl. When he returned the Princess looked downthe narrow neck of the big ornament and discovered her lost piglet, justas Eureka had said she would. Then the crowd cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten in her armsand told her how delighted she was to know that she was innocent. \"But why didn\\'t you tell us at first?\" she asked. \"It would have spoiled the fun,\" replied the kitten, yawning. CHAPTER 20. For the folks of Ozknew the kitten had tried to commit the crime, and that only an accidenthad prevented her from doing so; therefore even the Hungry Tigerpreferred not to associate with her. Eureka was forbidden to wanderaround the palace and was made to stay in confinement in Dorothy\\'s room;so she began to beg her mistress to send her to some other place whereshe could enjoy herself better. Dorothy was herself anxious to get home, so she promised Eureka theywould not stay in the Land of Oz much longer. The next evening after the trial the little girl begged Ozma to allowher to look in the enchanted picture, and the Princess readilyconsented. She took the child to her room and said: \"Make your wish,dear, and the picture will show the scene you desire to behold. \"Then Dorothy found, with the aid of the enchanted picture, that UncleHenry had returned to the farm in Kansas, and she also saw that both heand Aunt Em were dressed in mourning, because they thought their littleniece had been killed by the earthquake. \"Really,\" said the girl, anxiously, \"I must get back as soon as poss\\'bleto my own folks. \"Zeb also wanted to see his home, and although he did not find anyonemourning for him, the sight of Hugson\\'s Ranch in the picture made himlong to get back there. \"This is a fine country, and I like all the people that live in it,\" hetold Dorothy. \"But the fact is, Jim and I don\\'t seem to fit into afairyland, and the old horse has been begging me to go home again eversince he lost the race. So, if you can find a way to fix it, we\\'ll bemuch obliged to you. \"\"Ozma can do it, easily,\" replied Dorothy. \"Tomorrow morning I\\'ll go toKansas and you can go to Californy. \"[Illustration: \"I\\'M MUCH OBLIGED FOR ALL YOUR KINDNESS.\"]That last evening was so delightful that the boy will never forget it aslong as he lives. They were all together (except Eureka) in thepretty rooms of the Princess, and the Wizard did some new tricks, andthe Scarecrow told stories, and the Tin Woodman sang a love song in asonorous, metallic voice, and everybody laughed and had a good time. Then Dorothy wound up Tik-tok and he danced a jig to amuse the company,after which the Yellow Hen related some of her adventures with the NomeKing in the Land of Ev. The Princess served delicious refreshments to those who were in thehabit of eating, and when Dorothy\\'s bed time arrived the companyseparated after exchanging many friendly sentiments. Dorothy held Eureka in her arms and bade her friends a fond good-bye. \"You must come again, some time,\" said the little Wizard; and shepromised she would if she found it possible to do so. \"But Uncle Henry and Aunt Em need me to help them,\" she added, \"so Ican\\'t ever be very long away from the farm in Kansas. \"Ozma wore the Magic Belt; and, when she had kissed Dorothy farewell andhad made her wish, the little girl and her kitten disappeared in atwinkling. \"Where is she?\" asked Zeb, rather bewildered by the suddenness of it. \"Greeting her uncle and aunt in Kansas, by this time,\" returned Ozma,with a smile. \"I\\'m much obliged for all your kindness,\" said the boy, \"and verygrateful to you for saving my life and sending me home again after allthe good times I\\'ve had. Good-bye, everybody! Just ahead of them were the gates of Hugson\\'s Ranch, and UncleHugson now came out and stood with uplifted arms and wide open mouth,staring in amazement. \"Goodness gracious! he exclaimed. \"Where in theworld have you been, my lad?\"\"Why, in the world, Uncle,\" answered Zeb, with a laugh.

For they have flooded me withthousands of suggestions in regard to it, and I have honestly tried toadopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story. To have pleased you, to haveinterested you, to have won your friendship, and perhaps your love,through my stories, is to my mind as great an achievement as to becomePresident of the United States. So youhave helped me to fulfill my life\\'s ambition, and I am more grateful toyou, my dears, than I can express in words. It should have arrived at Hugson\\'ssiding at midnight, but it was already five o\\'clock and the gray dawnwas breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to theopen shed that served for the station-house. The conductor helped her off the car and then theengineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned andmoved slowly away up the track. The reason he was so late was becauseall through the night there were times when the solid earth shook andtrembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment therails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers. Thebuggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side curtains. Presentlyhe woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly. \"Hello!\" \"She climbed into the buggy and he followed her. \"But Jim knowshis business all right--don\\'t you, Jim?\" patting the long nose of theanimal. \"Only a day. Then he started to say something to his little companion,but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from sideto side and the earth seemed to rise up before them. \"What wasthat? Zeb shook thereins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn. There was abreath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth wouldshake violently. He was notgoing very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and attimes he would tremble like a leaf. With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit, drawingthe buggy and its occupants after him. Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence theywaited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or forthe earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in itsdreadful depths. The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or anumbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floateddownward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear. She began to realizethat death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merelystarted upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer andunusual as were those she had before encountered.  The central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun. Around it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other fivebrilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, oneblue and one orange. The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.   They saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, verylike those upon the earth\\'s surface; but all the scene was splendidlycolored by the variegated lights from the six suns. \"We arefalling so slowly that we can\\'t be dashed to pieces when we land, andthis country that we are coming to seems quite pretty. \"But don\\'t let us worryover such things, Zeb; we can\\'t help ourselves just now, you know, andI\\'ve always been told it\\'s foolish to borrow trouble. \"There\\'s Eureka. It\\'s this queer light that gives herthat color. Am I talking? A near by steeple hadbeen broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it. Otherbuildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents hadhappened to mar their perfection. They began to wonder if therewere no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner world. Suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one theywere on and stepped into plain view. He was not a very large man, butwas well formed and had a beautiful face--calm and serene as the face ofa fine portrait. His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeouslycolored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the sunbeamstouched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays. The man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticedthe presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly. For a good many years Idrew a public cab in Chicago, and that\\'s enough to make anyone skinny. \"Do I? \"I can see plenty of nice gardens andfields down below us, at the edge of this city. Zeb hesitated. He was still pale and frightened, for this dreadfuladventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried. It seemed firmenough to walk upon, so he took courage and put out the other foot. His great weight made him fall faster than thechildren walked, and he passed them on the way down; but when he came tothe glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was not evenjarred. \"People began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals,and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled. \"\"How can we do that?\" It is your affair, not mine. Instantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor; then itslowly spread and ascended into the dome, disclosing a strange personageseated upon a glass throne just before Jim\\'s nose. But he had no hair at all, and allover his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharpthorns like those found on the branches of rose-bushes. My sorcery tells me so. Eh? I had let so much gas out of my balloon that I could not rise again,and in a few minutes the earth closed over my head. Sorry to have troubled you; but itcouldn\\'t be helped. There sat the thorny Sorcerer in his chair of state, and when the Wizardsaw him he began to laugh, uttering comical little chuckles. Were you ever with a circus, brother? \"I belong toBailum & Barney\\'s Great Consolidated Shows--three rings in one tent anda menagerie on the side. \"I go up in a balloon, usually, to draw the crowds to the circus. ButI\\'ve just had the bad luck to come out of the sky, skip the solid earth,and land lower down than I intended. \"But they had no handkerchiefs, either. The Wizard reached out, caught the wee creature in hishand, and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tailbetween the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart, each of the twoparts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant. The Wizard continued this surprisingperformance until nine tiny piglets were running about at his feet, allsquealing and grunting in a very comical way. This the Wizard placed underneath his hat and made a mysticsign above it. \"Why not?\" enquired the Wizard. \"About five minutes. Watch me carefully. By the time he hadattached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe,as the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect. So the Wizard lost no more time, but leaping forward he raised the sharpsword, whirled it once or twice around his head, and then gave a mightystroke that cut the body of the Sorcerer exactly in two. \"Why, he\\'s vegetable!\" Are you not vegetable, also? \"\"Certainly, sir. He is really dead now, and will wither very quickly. THE VEGETABLE KINGDOMAfter the Wizard had wiped the dampness from his sword and taken itapart and put the pieces into their leathern case again, the man withthe star ordered some of his people to carry the two halves of theSorcerer to the public gardens. \"\"Can\\'t you mend them?\" she enquired. Then they put the two halves of the Sorcerer into it and coveredhim up. It appeared that these odd people, while they were able to walk throughthe air with ease, usually moved upon the ground in the ordinary way. Inside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsomeplants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearlyreached the ground. The growing Mangaboos were of all sizes, from the blossom that had justturned into a wee baby to the full-grown and almost ripe man or woman. On some of the bushes might be seen a bud, a blossom, a baby, ahalf-grown person and a ripe one; but even those ready to pluck weremotionless and silent, as if devoid of life. \"You will notice they are all attached to theplants by the soles of their feet, and when they are quite ripe they areeasily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers of motionand speech. \"If wekeep cool and moist, and meet with no accidents, we often live for fiveyears. No, indeed. \"He led them within another but smaller circle of hedge, where grew onelarge and beautiful bush. The maiden\\'s gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds,while dainty lace-like traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves. When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty ofthe Mangaboos to her. He hesitated. \"She\\'s as perfect as she canbe. \"Ithink I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick,for he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us. But the rest of youmust be destroyed in some way, and you cannot be planted, because I donot wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country.  I have been ready for picking all the past week, butbecause you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule,you left me to stand silent upon my bush. They did not bother to cross the bridgesover the brooks, but when they came to a stream they stepped high andwalked in the air to the other side.  But I\\'ve noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries. In the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons, andseveral other unknown but delicious fruits, of which they ate heartily.  In the strict senseof the word I am not a Wizard, but only a humbug. But the pulling of them apartand pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick. \"I\\'mawfully hungry. Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold and moist asthe vegetables themselves. The only bait he could find was abright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool ifanything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try theblossom. Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearbybrook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and wascaught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sureenough, the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore,where it began to flop around in great excitement. \"But I don\\'t think that fish had anybones, because I didn\\'t feel them scratch my throat. \"I\\'m glad we are not fishes!\" \"Then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were oneor two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, andshe went to the buggy and brought them. \"They agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jimdrew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall. It was the same sort of climb oneexperiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breathwhen they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to bedoorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house. Followingthese halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and somewere furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs. But there were nobeds at all. Zeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself free,rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with Eurekanestling comfortably beside his big, boney body. Thelittle man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, andlooking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up onhis bench and yawning. I am greater than anythorn-covered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden. Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others ornot. Then he jointed together the blades of hissword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose. Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oilwhich Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a cleveridea from those commonplace things. Theglare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of thesix great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and clearly. When he lighted the oil ahundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing. Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be draggedfrom the fire, and all were so withered that it would be necessary toplant them at once. They were even permitted to occupy theHouse of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and towander in the gardens in search of food. Theysaw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing andtwisting around like a nest of great snakes. Everything the vinestouched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to haveescaped being cast among them. Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny pigletsfrom his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room toamuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found hisglass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom partof the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could. he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of theround, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyedthe sport very greatly. Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent,solemn-eyed Mangaboos. The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to thedoorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they weredriven from the room and out upon the street. Slowly but steadily theheartless Mangaboos drove them on, until they had passed through thecity and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to themountain. \"\"What would you do?\" enquired Jim. \"An instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos andkicked out his hind legs as hard as he could. A dozen of them smashedtogether and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kickedagain and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them inall directions and sending the others scattering to escape his ironheels. They tired Jim andEureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered withmashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up at lastand allow themselves to be driven to the mountain. \"This is dreadful!\" groaned Jim. \"It will be about the end of ouradventures, I guess. The Mangaboos saw her escape, and several of them caught up theirthorns and gave chase, mounting through the air after her. Some of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House ofthe Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetablepeople allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in acrowd behind them so that they could not go back again. \"I\\'d as soon die here as live muchlonger among those cruel and heartless people. Zeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns. The rays of thecolored suns were now shut out from them forever, for the last chinkshad been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the Landof the Mangaboos. \"It isn\\'t a bad road,\" observed the Wizard, \"and if we followed it itmight lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this blackpocket we are now in. Sometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazedthe sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floorwas usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without anyaccident. \"But they kept steadily moving, and just as Jim was about tired out withhis long journey the way suddenly grew lighter, and Zeb put out thelanterns to save the oil. To their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them, forall were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, hadmade their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays. Jim hastened his lagging steps at thisassurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few momentsmore they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face toface with a new and charming country. It was all laid out into lovely lawns andgardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautifuland stately trees dotting the landscape here and there. Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between theirflower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of thequaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld. None of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each hadample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it. As the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enrapturedby its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air, whichthey breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel. One was that itwas lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon was in thearched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a clear andperfect light. All appeared mysteriously deserted. With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over theloose rocks until he reached the green lawns below, where the paths andorchards and gardens began. Slowly they walked along the path toward the nearestcottage, the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim pausingat every step for another mouthful of grass. \"Here,--piggy, piggy, piggy!\" called their master, anxiously. The Wizard stooped down and put out his hand, and at once felt the smallfat body of one of his pets. \"I only hope it wasn\\'tpoison. \"But _we_ The travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage, which theypresently reached. The door stood open and a table was set inthe front room, with four chairs drawn up to it. On the table wereplates, knives and forks, and dishes of bread, meat and fruits. What do you call it? \"But we do not wish to intrude, I assure you,\" the Wizard hastened tosay. \"He draws the buggy you see fastened to him, and we ride in the buggyinstead of walking,\" she explained. \"No! \" Yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature,the dainty flowers and trees, the green fields and the clear blue of thesky. Eureka was frantic with terror, and tried toscratch and bite, so the next moment she was dropped to the floor. she gasped. As forreaching the top of the earth, I have never heard that it is possible todo that, and if you succeeded in getting there you would probably falloff. \"\"The Valley of Voe is certainly a charming place,\" resumed the Wizard;\"but we cannot be contented in any other land than our own, for long. Our greatest Champion, Overman-Anu, onceclimbed the spiral stairway and fought nine days with the Gargoylesbefore he could escape them and come back; but he could never be inducedto describe the dreadful creatures, and soon afterward a bear caughthim and ate him up. But theywere in great numbers, and the Champion could not shout much because hehad to save his breath for fighting. \"\" \"They now bade farewell to the kind but unseen people of the cottage, andafter the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shapedmountain on the opposite side of the Valley, and told them how to travelin order to reach it, they again started upon their journey. Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about, and there were manyof the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of. \"\"How _can_ we \\'scape?\" \"\"But we would be drowned!\" They did not sink at all, owing to the virtues of the strangeplant they had used, and when the buggy was in the middle of the streamthe Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim. \"Run for the river!\" shouted the Wizard, and Jim quickly freed himselffrom his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed. At once he began stabbing atthe air with his sword, and he knew that he had struck some substancebecause when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood. Thebeast was quite dead from the sword thrusts, and after a glance at itsterrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic andrushed out upon the water, for other menacing growls told him more bearswere near. \"Ifour unknown friend hadn\\'t warned us, and told us what to do, we wouldall be dead by this time. \"Jim did not make a mile a minute; but almost before they were aware ofit he drew up at the foot of the mountain, so suddenly that the Wizardand Zeb both sailed over the dashboard and landed in the softgrass--where they rolled over several times before they stopped. Directly facing the place where Jim hadstopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway. The stairswere cut in the rock inside the mountain, and they were broad and notvery steep, because they circled around like a cork-screw, and at thearched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big.     DANGER! KEEP OUT. Below them wasa vast space, at the bottom of which was a black sea with rollingbillows, through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up. Mortals who stand upon the earthand look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms, but ourfriends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the daintyfairies very clearly. \"They are the Cloud Fairies. \"In the open space between the clouds and the black, bubbling sea farbeneath, could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its wayswiftly through the air. These birds were of enormous size, and remindedZeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights. They had fierceeyes and sharp talons and beaks, and the children hoped none of themwould venture into the cavern. \"Well, I declare!\" \"They turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the centerof the cave, who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted theirattention. These were so long thatthey reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard werecarefully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid fastenedwith a bow of colored ribbon. \" But \"Well, I make Assorted Flutters for flags and bunting, and a superiorgrade of Rustles for ladies\\' silk gowns. \"May we examine some ofthese articles? Here, on abroad shelf, were several card-board boxes of various sizes, each tiedwith cotton cord. They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day, whenthere is no wind. You, sir,\" turning to the Wizard, \"ought to have thisassortment. It is a sad story, but if you will try to restrainyour tears I will tell you about it. On earth I was a manufacturer ofImported Holes for American Swiss Cheese, and I will acknowledge that Isupplied a superior article, which was in great demand. Also I madepores for porous plasters and high-grade holes for doughnuts andbuttons. Finally I invented a new Adjustable Post-hole, which I thoughtwould make my fortune. I manufactured a large quantity of thesepost-holes, and having no room in which to store them I set them all endto end and put the top one in the ground. That made an extraordinarylong hole, as you may imagine, and reached far down into the earth; and,as I leaned over it to try to see to the bottom, I lost my balance andtumbled in. Unfortunately, the hole led directly into the vast space yousee outside this mountain; but I managed to catch a point of rock thatprojected from this cavern, and so saved myself from tumbling headlonginto the black waves beneath, where the tongues of flame that dart outwould certainly have consumed me. So they politely bade him good day, and went back to the outercavern to resume their journey. \" \"\" \"Eureka yawned and stretched herself. At last, however, a dim light appeared ahead of them, which grew clearerand stronger as they advanced. \"Nonsense!\" snapped the tired Wizard. \"I\\'ve taken a look at this place, andit\\'s no fit country for real creatures to go to. \"With this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remainingsteps. The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broadplatform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyeshad ever beheld. The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hardknots from trees, worn smooth in course of time. The tree-trunkswere of coarse wood, but the leaves of the trees were shavings. These were very numerous, for the palace was thickly inhabited, and alarge group of the queer people clustered near, gazing sharply upon thestrangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway. The Gargoyles were very small of stature, being less than three feet inheight. There were many types, indeed, scarcely two being alike; butall were equally disagreeable in appearance. This noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about theGargoyles. The group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered nearthe stairs at first remained staring and motionless, glaring with evileyes at the intruders who had so suddenly appeared in their land. \"He got his satchel from the buggy and, opening it, took out two deadlylooking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just tolook at. \"If we had known we were coming we might have brought along severalother useful things,\" responded the Wizard. \"But we dropped into thisadventure rather unexpectedly. \"The Gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound oftalking, for although our friends had spoken in low tones their wordsseemed loud in the silence surrounding them. But as soon as theconversation ceased the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock andflew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out beforethem like the bowsprits of a fleet of sail-boats. But Jim was ready for them, and when he saw them coming he turned hisheels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could. bang! But the Wizard was not so confident. They advanced in a great swarm, having been joined by many more oftheir kind, and they flew straight over Jim\\'s head to where the otherswere standing. Half ofthe bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out, so it had been the jarand the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down, more than thefact that it was really hurt. Then a few of themadvanced until another shot from the Wizard\\'s revolver made themretreat. In this way none of them was shocked by thedreadful report more than once, for the main band kept far away andeach time a new company was sent into the battle. When the Wizard hadfired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemyexcept to stun a few by the noise, and so he was no nearer to victorythan in the beginning of the fray. The bound Gargoyle\\'s arms extended far out beyond its head, so bygrasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club. This daunted the enemy for a time, but the defenders were soon out ofbreath. Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a clubuntil he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they clusteredso thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing hisarms. But all this bravery amounted to nothing at all. Eureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the groundlike a streak; but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and grabbed herbefore she had gone very far. The houses of this city had many corners, being square andsix-sided and eight-sided. To one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows, but only onebroad opening far up underneath the roof, the prisoners were brought bytheir captors. \"The space underneath the roof, where they stood, permitted them to seeon all sides of the tall building, and they looked with much curiosityat the city spread out beneath them. Everything visible was made ofwood, and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural. Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search, but nothingmore; so after a time they came back to the platform again. In this country, as in all others they had visited underneath theearth\\'s surface, there was no night, a constant and strong light comingfrom some unknown source. \"All peopleneed rest, even if they are made of wood, and as there is no night herethey select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or doze. \"Where? \"No; she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides ofthis house to the ground. \"Wherever have you been, Eureka?\" \"\"What, the hinges?  \"Do you see that big rock standing on the hillsideyonder?\" he continued, pointing with his finger. \"Well, inside that rock, which reaches up into the clouds, is an archwayvery much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral stairwayfrom the Valley of Voe. They can hear a pin drop. However, the Wizard went once more to hissatchel--which seemed to contain a surprising variety of odds andends--and brought out a spool of strong wire, by means of which theymanaged to fasten four of the wings to Jim\\'s harness, two near his headand two near his tail. So the prisonersresolved to leave their prison at once. The only thing that anyone couldcomplain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled first up andthen down, as if the road were rocky instead of being as smooth as theair could make it. Then he poured over them all the kerosene oil that was left in hisoil-can, and lighting a match set fire to the pile. \"To their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular flightof steps by means of which they could mount to the earth\\'s surface. Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrowgallery where the buggy could not pass. It carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there weregood roads, and since it had accompanied them so far in their travelsthey felt it their duty to preserve it. So Zeb and the Wizard set towork and took off the wheels and the top, and then they put the buggyedgewise, so it would take up the smallest space. It was not a great distance,fortunately, and when the path grew broader they put the buggy togetheragain and proceeded more comfortably. But the road was nothing more thana series of rifts or cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag inevery direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzledas to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than whenthey had started, hours before. \"Once in a while they would come to a deep crack in the floor, which madethe way quite dangerous; but there was still enough oil in the lanternsto give them light, and the cracks were not so wide but that they wereable to jump over them.  But the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last, onturning a sharp corner, the wanderers found themselves in a vast cavearching high over their heads and having a smooth, level floor. The cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to theground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being alwaysside by side. These were motionless at first, but soon began to flickermore brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down. \"Woogh!\" snarled Eureka, arching her back until her hair stood straighton end; \"it\\'s a den of alligators, or crocodiles, or some other dreadfulcreatures! They\\'re uglierthan the Gargoyles. \"Hearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound,and the Wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one ofthe little pockets in the rock. \"Why, it\\'s a dragon!\" \"She has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner. \"No?\" drawled the dragonette; \"it seems to me very babyish. \"Mother\\'s about two thousand years old; but she carelessly lost track ofher age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds. Being reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out oftheir rock-pockets, the children and the Wizard now took time to examinethem more closely. The heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrelsand covered with hard, greenish scales that glittered brightly under thelight of the lanterns. \"For, if we told you truly, you might escape us altogether; and if wetold you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished. \"They circled all around the cavern, keeping a good distance away fromthe blinking yellow eyes of the dragonettes, and presently discoveredthat there were two paths leading from the wall opposite to the placewhere they had entered. They selected one of these at a venture andhurried along it as fast as they could go, for they had no idea when themother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make heracquaintance. Butat length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off thepassage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther. This rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion,turning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot. When first theycame to it there was a solid wall before them; but presently it revolveduntil there was exposed a wide, smooth path across it to the other side. This appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to takeadvantage of it at first, and allowed the rocky wall to swing aroundagain before they had decided to pass over. But they knew now that therewas a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path appearedfor the second time. They heard a crunching, grinding sound, a loud snap, and the turn-tablecame to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path fromwhich they had come. \"\"It is possible,\" agreed the Wizard, \"if this proves to be the path sheusually takes. But I have been examining this tunnel, and I do not seeany signs of so large a beast having passed through it. \"It\\'s enough to have your pedigree flungin your face by those saucy dragonettes.  But their journey was almost over, for in a short time they reached asmall cave from which there was no further outlet. But when the adventurerslooked more carefully around them they discovered that they were in astrong prison from which there was no hope of escape. \"Folks don\\'t fall into the middle of the earth and then getback again to tell of their adventures--not in real life. \"The reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had notenjoyed much exercise lately, and must be tired of their prison in hispocket. So he sat down upon the floor of the cave, brought the pigletsout one by one, and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased. \"The Wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers. \"But I\\'m not, my piggy-wees; I\\'m a humbug wizard. But I am one of the greatest humbugwizards that ever lived, and you will realize this when we have allstarved together and our bones are scattered over the floor of thislonely cave. \"\"Ozma!\" \"Who is Ozma? \"She\\'s afriend of mine, for I met her in the Land of Ev, not long ago, and wentto Oz with her. After you went up in a balloon, and escaped us, I got back toKansas by means of a pair of magical silver shoes. Have you them here with you?\"\"No; I lost them somewhere in the air,\" explained the child. \"\"And were you?\"  \"\"Take us, too!\" \"They are still proud of theirformer Wizard, and often speak of you kindly. \"\"A what?\"\"A sawhorse.  \"\"Pah! Before them were the jewel-studded gates of a magnificent palace, andnow the gates opened slowly as if inviting them to enter the courtyard,where splendid flowers were blooming and pretty fountains shot theirsilvery sprays into the air. OLD FRIENDS ARE REUNITEDMany servants dressed in handsome uniforms stood ready to welcome thenew arrivals, and when the Wizard got out of the buggy a pretty girl ina green gown cried out in surprise:\"Why, it\\'s Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, come back again! Such magnificence andwealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever dreamedof, and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter was realand not tinsel. Zeb was also escorted to a room--so grand and beautiful that he almostfeared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed, lest he might dim theirsplendor. Opening from the chamber was a fine bath-room having a marble tub withperfumed water; so the boy, still dazed by the novelty of hissurroundings, indulged in a good bath and then selected a maroon velvetcostume with silver buttons to replace his own soiled and much wornclothing. There were silk stockings and soft leather slippers withdiamond buckles to accompany his new costume, and when he was fullydressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before inhis life. Taken altogether, it was a dreadfullylong name to weigh down a poor innocent child, and one of the hardestlessons I ever learned was to remember my own name. \"At that time,\" continued the Wizard, busily eating his soup whiletalking, \"there were four separate countries in this Land, each one ofthe four being ruled by a Witch. But the people thought my power wasgreater than that of the Witches; and perhaps the Witches thought sotoo, for they never dared oppose me. Then the Witchesdivided up the kingdom, and ruled the four parts of it until you camehere. The Wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw man,who was an important personage in the Land of Oz. \"I\\'m very certain, Oz, thatyou gave me the best brains in the world, for I can think with them dayand night, when all other brains are fast asleep. ButOzma soon conquered her, with the help of Glinda the Good, and afterthat I went to live with Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman. \"Just then a loud cackling was heard outside; and, when a servant threwopen the door with a low bow, a yellow hen strutted in. Around Billina\\'s neck was a string of beautiful pearls, and on her legswere bracelets of emeralds. \"It keeps finely, being preservedin my air-tight chest. \"Zeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people; butthey were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them verymuch, even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen. \"This I am, in reality, a very big bug, anddoubtless the most intelligent being in all this broad domain. Nobody minded this rudeness, which might have seemed more impolite inone less thoroughly educated; so they straightway forgot him and joinedin a merry conversation that kept them well amused until bed-timearrived. \"The servants were a little discouraged, but soon they brought in a greattray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast. \"Do you take mefor a weasel? How stupid and ignorant you are, in the Land of Oz, andwhat dreadful things you feed upon! \"Oats? In the morning, as soon as it was daylight, he resolved to take a walkand try to find some grass for breakfast; so he ambled calmly throughthe handsome arch of the doorway, turned the corner of the palace,wherein all seemed asleep, and came face to face with the Sawhorse. Jim stopped abruptly, being startled and amazed. The legs of theSawhorse were four sticks driven into holes bored in the log; its tailwas a small branch that had been left by accident and its mouth a placechopped in one end of the body which projected a little and served asa head. [Illustration: \"FOR GOODNESS SAKE, WHAT SORT OF A BEING ARE YOU?\"]Jim\\'s eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse, and he stared atthe creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until itrested against his arched neck. In this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each otherfor a while, each being unable to realize what the singular thing mightbe which it now beheld for the first time. \"\"You are, indeed. theytreat me with great respect.  \" \"Youdo not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you, northe delight of eating delicious food, nor the satisfaction of drawing along breath of fresh, pure air. To be called beautiful was a novelty inhis experience. And this is the Hungry Tiger, the terror of the jungle, who longsto devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from doing so. \"Hearing these words Jim resolved to conquer his alarm. \"If he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he wasmistaken. Some day Iwill let you try to crush in my skull, and afterward you will know moreabout tigers than you do now. \"I thought you were stuffed. THE NINE TINY PIGLETSAfter breakfast Ozma announced that she had ordered a holiday to beobserved throughout the Emerald City, in honor of her visitors. Thepeople had learned that their old Wizard had returned to them and allwere anxious to see him again, for he had always been a rare favorite. The procession was very imposing. First came the Imperial Cornet Band ofOz, dressed in emerald velvet uniforms with slashes of pea-green satinand buttons of immense cut emeralds. They played the National aircalled \"The Oz Spangled Banner,\" and behind them were the standardbearers with the Royal flag. Tik-tok moved by clockwork, and was made all of burnished copper. There followed another band after this, which was called the Royal CourtBand, because the members all lived in the palace. They wore whiteuniforms with real diamond buttons and played \"What is Oz without Ozma\"very sweetly. Then came Professor Woggle-Bug, with a group of students from the RoyalCollege of Scientific Athletics. The boys wore long hair and stripedsweaters and yelled their college yell every other step they took, tothe great satisfaction of the populace, which was glad to have thisevidence that their lungs were in good condition. The brilliantly polished Tin Woodman marched next, at the head of theRoyal Army of Oz which consisted of twenty-eight officers, from Generalsdown to Captains. There were no privates in the army because all were socourageous and skillful that they had been promoted one by one untilthere were no privates left. wanted one of them to pet and play with. Afterward it was noticed that the Wizard always performed his famoustrick with eight piglets, but it seemed to please the people just aswell as if there had been nine of them. There was enough materialthere to enable him to prepare several new tricks which he had learnedfrom some of the jugglers in the circus, and he had passed part of thenight in getting them ready. There was a beautiful canopy for Ozmaand her guests to sit under and watch the people run races and jump andwrestle. \"So they unharnessed Jim and took the saddle off the Sawhorse, and thetwo queerly matched animals were stood side by side for the start. \"\"Go!\" Jim\\'s big hoofs pounded away at a great rate, and although he did notlook very graceful he ran in a way to do credit to his Kentuckybreeding. But the Sawhorse was swifter than the wind. I am sorry to record the fact that Jim was not only ashamed of hisdefeat but for a moment lost control of his temper. As he looked at thecomical face of the Sawhorse he imagined that the creature was laughingat him; so in a fit of unreasonable anger he turned around and made avicious kick that sent his rival tumbling head over heels upon theground, and broke off one of its legs and its left ear. An instant later the Tiger crouched and launched its huge body throughthe air swift and resistless as a ball from a cannon. \"No one must injure one of our friends in our presence,\" growled theLion; and Zeb ran to Jim and whispered that unless he controlled histemper in the future he would probably be torn to pieces. \"There was more applause at this, and then Ozma had the jewelled saddlereplaced upon the Sawhorse and herself rode the victor back to the cityat the head of the grand procession. Jellia at once departed on the errand, and she was gone so long thatthey had almost forgotten her mission when the green robed maidenreturned with a troubled face. \"Your actions alone accuse you. \"They now separated to prepare for the sad ceremony; for whenever anappeal is made to law sorrow is almost certain to follow--even in afairyland like Oz. All the piglets are exactly alike, so no one candispute your word. This deception will save Eureka\\'s life, and then wemay all be happy again. \"After some thought he placed the little pig inside his funnel-shapedhat, and then put the hat upon his head and went back to his room tothink over his speech to the jury. Behind her throne stood thetwenty-eight officers of her army and many officials of the royalhousehold. And now, at a signal from Ozma, the Woggle-Bug arose and addressed thejury. \"Your Royal Highness and Fellow Citizens,\" he began; \"the small cat yousee a prisoner before you is accused of the crime of first murdering andthen eating our esteemed Ruler\\'s fat piglet--or else first eating andthen murdering it. In either case a grave crime has been committed whichdeserves a grave punishment. \"\"Let the Public Accuser continue,\" called Ozma from her throne, \"and Ipray you do not interrupt him. And finally she made a wicked plan tosatisfy her depraved appetite for pork. \"It\\'s blind. \"Very likely,\" acknowledged the Woggle-Bug. \"There was great applause when the speaker sat down. (Here Eureka baredher sharp claws and scratched at the bars of the cage.) \"When the Tin Woodman sat down no one applauded him, for his argumentshad not been very convincing and few believed that he had provedEureka\\'s innocence. If he can produce but seven,then this it not the piglet that was lost, but another one. \"\"Hush, Eureka!\" warned the Wizard. \"Don\\'t be foolish,\" advised the Tin Woodman, \"or you may be sorry forit. At once I jumped up and told thepiglet not to make a fuss, for he would be inside of me in half asecond; but no one can teach one of these creatures to be reasonable. At first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and Ithought I should get him, after all, but he wriggled himself through andfell down into the deep bottom part--and I suppose he\\'s there yet. \"All were astonished at this confession, and Ozma at once sent an officerto her room to fetch the vase. There was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase, sothe Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisonerfree. Ozma gave the Wizard back the piglet he had so kindly allowed NickChopper to substitute for the lost one, and then she carried her owninto the apartments of the palace where she lived. ZEB RETURNS TO THE RANCHEureka was much surprised to find herself in disgrace; but she was, inspite of the fact that she had not eaten the piglet. Then Zeb brought out Jim, all harnessed to the buggy, and took his seat. I think this is the loveliest country in theworld; but not being fairies Jim and I feel we ought to be where webelong--and that\\'s at the ranch. Jim was trotting along thewell-known road, shaking his ears and whisking his tail with a contentedmotion.

       " 58: 'Markov ChainsIntroductionMarkov chains and Monte Carlo Markov chains are mathematical processes that are based on probability and are commonly used in statistics. Monte Carlo Markov chains are a class of algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, leveraging the Markov chain framework to model systems like weather, stock prices, or molecular interactions. A key application is statistical inference - using Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov process to estimate properties of complex distributions and models that cannot be easily analyzed directly. Overall, Markov chains provide a mathematical framework to model random processes over time, while Monte Carlo Markov chains use this to build simulation models for generating sample data from probability distributions of interest across many areas of science, finance, and machine learning. Formulating Markov Chains MathematicallyAt its core, a Markov chain comprises a discrete set of states and transition probabilities between each pair of states. Algorithms like Monte Carlo methods can also simulate trajectories of Markov processes by randomly hopping states guided by the transition probabilities. Monte Carlo MethodThe Monte Carlo method refers to a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The basic concept is to use probability statistics computed from simulations using random number sequences to estimate properties of some process or model. In computer science, Monte Carlo methods are commonly used for risk analysis, optimization, inference, and machine learning. With advances in computational power, Monte Carlo is a versatile, parallelizable, and ever-growing approach for practical stochastic modeling and estimation. Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC)A Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) combines Markov chain sampling with Monte Carlo simulation for efficient numerical analysis and statistical estimation. When combined with random sampling over many independent iterations in the Monte Carlo framework, MCMC allows efficient exploring and learning of the properties of extremely complex high-dimensional probability distributions, used widely from computational physics to modern machine learning. The states traversed form a Markov chain, while the randomness injected through Monte Carlo testing enables broader coverage for improved generalizability. On each turn, you advance a random number of steps based on the rolled dice value. Even far-away spots now have a chance of being visited through random big dice rolls combined with climbing ladders. MCMC stats methods do the same - randomized Monte Carlo dice rolls are combined with Markov Chain ladder climbs to solve problems. The random dice rolls ensure you experience more possibilities to learn the rules better! In summary, MCMC combines targeted but stable Markov Chain exploration with excited dashing about via Monte Carlo randomness - letting you understand big new worlds faster. MCMC in RobotsMonte Carlo Markov chains demonstrate great utility for reinforcement learning algorithms seeking to maximize cumulative rewards by interacting with complex environments. By incorporating randomness to regularly sample exploratory actions during training, the Monte Carlo aspect ensures better coverage for improved policy learning. Blending temporary memoryless state transitions with randomized jumps thus makes Monte Carlo Markov methods exceptionally suitable for reinforcement learning problems.',\n",
       " 59: 'A Markov chain is a random process that moves from one state to another, with the next state depending only on the current state - hence it has the Markov \"memoryless\" property. This is commonly represented as a state transition matrix , where each element  denotes the probability of moving from state  to state  on a given step. The current state combined with  fully parametrizes the next state - encapsulating the memoryless Markov property. Mathematically, if  is a random variable representing the system state at time , then  This formula signifies the conditional distribution of future states depends only on the current state. The Markov property - where the current state encapsulates necessary context - allows generating text word-by-word based on preceding terms. The key advantage of a Markov chain process is that future states depend only on the current state - no historical trajectory is required. This memoryless property allows hopping to completely new states based solely on transition probabilities.',\n",
       " 60: 'A simple example is modeling a sequence of days with sunny or rainy weather, where the weather on a given day is randomly determined based solely on the weather of the previous day. This pure probabilistic approach enables modeling phenomena from physics, biology, and beyond for theoretical and practical insights. This establishes a lightweight, yet versatile approach compared to heavy parameterization with neural networks. By optimizing cumulative future reward, the model learns probable transitions between words reflecting sensible narratives. For example, initializing the state with \"Alice was\" and sampling subsequent actions as words yield:\"Alice was heading to the store when...\"\"Alice was shocked to discover that...\"\"Alice was running late for her appointment...\"The model associates those sentences starting with the phrase \"Alice was\" which commonly transitions towards other verbs or plot-advancing events. Their efficient yet effective learning drives adoptions in chatbots for dialog modeling or summarization systems for extracting key points - producing sensible language output without laborious feature engineering. A very simple example is estimating  - we could generate random (x,y) points on a square enclosed in a circle and count what fraction falls inside the circle to estimate its area relative to the square. As the number of samples increases, the estimate converges to , based on area geometry. Common applications include pathfinding, decision tree learning, and evaluating multidimensional integrals in physics simulations that are too complex to solve analytically. The algorithms are useful since they are often easier to implement than deriving explicit solutions while providing great flexibility. Together they provide a versatile yet lightweight framework to model real-world stochastic processes like financial trends, genome sequencing, and social networks. MCMC in layman\\'s termsMCMC is like playing a board game to explore new places. Imagine you are playing Snakes and Ladders. Your piece starts at the beginning. Where you land next depends only on your current spot - if you land at the bottom of a ladder, you climb up and advance faster! Now let us add dice rolling like in Monopoly. This randomness helps you explore more spots, not only the connected ones. This way you get to know the board better compared to moving along just adjacent squares! It allows studying huge complex game boards by directly hopping between interesting features through many simulated traversals, something too long by standard play. Consider training a robot to navigate obstacle courses. The state space encoding positions and sensor data are enormous - far too large to explore exhaustively in a reasonable time. After sufficient simulation iterations, high-reward state-action sequences are discovered without prohibitively expensive physical trial-and-error. ',\n",

In the computing educationcontext, these models are being used to generate code, codeexplanations, and programming exercises. The rapid adoptionof these models has prompted multiple position papers andworkshops which discuss the implications of these models forcomputing education, both positive and negative. This paperpresents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with12 students and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences,and preferences regarding the use of tools powered by generativeAI in computing classrooms. The results suggest that GenerativeAI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant role incomputing education. However, students and instructors alsoraised numerous concerns about how these models should beintegrated to best support the needs and learning goals ofstudents. We also identified interesting tensions and alignmentsthat emerged between how instructors and students prefer toengage with these models. As GAI tools become in-creasingly prevalent, it’s important to understand educationalstakeholders’ preferences and values to ensure that these toolscan be used for good and that potential harms can be mitigated. Index Terms —Generative models, large language models, com-puting education, student perceptions, instructor perceptionsI. I NTRODUCTION The introduction of Generative AI (GAI) models has ledto significant excitement in the computing education com-munity [1]–[10]. These generative models are typically pow-ered by large language models such as GPT-3 or Codexwhich are capable of producing code explanations [5], [6],[9] that have been rated as being better than peer-generatedexplanations [9]. In addition, these models can solve basicprogramming assignments [1], [7] and perform slightly worsethan students on quizzes with multiple-choice questions [8]. Understandably, these substantial and rapid advances in theperformance of generative models are causing excitementand consternation among students and instructors. A recentbirds of a feather discussion at the SIGCSE conference [11]highlighted a few emerging concerns that educators haverelated to over-reliance, plagiarism, and other forms of misuse. These concerns have been echoed by position papers [7], [12],a working group [13], and an investigation into instructorperspectives [14]. However, these concerns only scratch thesurface, there is an urgent need to understand students’ andinstructors’ preferences about and what they want from theseGAI tools so that future development and regulation can alignwith the values of these critical stakeholders. In this paper, we conduct an interview study with 18participants including both students (N=12) and instructors(N=6). The goal of this interview study is to better understandthese two key stakeholders’ awareness of these models andtheir preferences about how these models should be usedin computing education classrooms. terested in what ways students and instructors envision theinvolvement of generative AI in computing education, bothpositively and negatively. In this paper, we investigate three research questions:RQ1 : What preferences do instructors and students haveregarding how Generative AI should be used in comput-ing education classes? RQ2 : What concerns do instructors and students have re-garding the use of Generative AI in computing education? What implications might Generative AI have oncomputing education curricula, pedagogy, and assessmentmethods? The results from our study suggest that students and in- structors believe computing course curricula and assessmentmethods should be updated to include GAI tools; however,there are important challenges which need to be addressed inorder to use them successfully while reducing their potentialharm to instructors and students alike. These results providearXiv:2308.04309v1  [cs.HC]  8 Aug 2023a timely and important snapshot of students’ and instructors’perspectives and preferences which can inform the design ofpedagogies, tools, and policies that best align with students’preferences and needs. R ELATED WORKA. An AI Phase-Shift in the ClassroomLess than three decades ago, widespread access to theInternet fundamentally changed the education landscape. Asinternet access in the United States rose from 14 to 77 percent,students could suddenly access educational resources, playeducational games, and interact with peers in online learningcommunities. This inequitable access to these resources alsoled to a digital divide where some students were left behindbecause they did not have personal computers or reliableinternet access [15]. Recent advances in AI are poised to createa similar phase shift in the education landscape. AI-poweredtools are becoming ubiquitous both in online and face-to-facelearning environments. From a student’s perspective, these AI-powered tools provide a number of important benefits suchas an increased awareness of their performance, personalizedlearning pathways [16], and personalized support in the formof intelligent tutors [17], [18]. From an instructor’s perspec-tive, learning analytics tools provide instructors with the abilityto monitor student activity and adapt their teaching [19]–[22]. Some of these tools are even integrated into classroomenvironments where instructors can use augmented reality tomonitor student learning, metacognition, and behavior in real-time [23]. discuss additional ways in which AIin the classroom can be beneficial for instructors such asin improving student reviews, grading, and feedback, utiliz-ing intelligent tutoring systems, and improving pedagogicalpractices and student experiences using AI-powered VR forexperiential or practical learning experiences [24]. However, many of these advances have been limited bythe current abilities of machine learning. Recent advances inmachine learning have introduced generative models capableof understanding and generating code have crucial implicationsfor computing education. Researchers are already demonstrat-ing the capabilities of these models to help students generatecode [3], [25], [26], explain code to students [5], [6], However,there are also some emerging challenges related to over-reliance and plagiarism [5], [11]. For instance, a recent studyshowed how these models can perform nearly as well asstudents on multiple-choice questions [8]. Considering the Design of AI Systems The introduction of AI systems has led to new designchallenges related to their probabilistic nature, their lack oftransparency, and their issues related to fairness and These challenges have led to rapidly evolving researchtopics such as explainable AI (XAI), human-AI interaction(HAII), and human-centered machine learning. Across these fields,there is a resounding call to focus on approaches that arehuman-centered [27]. Additionally, people calibrate their trust through interactionsand experiences with the AI system [29]; however, otherfactors such as age, culture, and personality can also affecttrust in AI systems [30]. Numerous computing education researchers are already ad-dressing these issues of explainability, trust, and over-reliance. Their framework outlined 6 importantfactors to consider when building XAI: who the stakeholdersare (e.g., instructors and students), what benefits stakeholdersreceive from interacting with the system, what potential issuesstakeholders may encounter when using the system, howexplanations are presented, what AI models are used, and thebest ways to design user-friendly and effective AIED systems. However, the usage of GAI tools in education, suchas ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, poses a unique problem, asthey were not developed solely for an educational purpose andtheir inclusion in the classroom may have unknown effects. Many researchers have begun to explore the potential negativeeffects the inclusion of these models into education may bring,including bias and fairness of these models, over-reliance,explainability, and trust [7], [11]. M ETHODOLOGYTo investigate our research questions about student and in- The field ofcomputing education has begun adopting interview studies[36]–[39], often to explore the perspectives of instructorsor students with respect to topics such as instructor painpoints [40] or student perspectives about online versus on-site teaching [41]. In this study, we focus on the perspectivesof both instructors and students because it is critical to includeall relevant stakeholders when considering the implications ofnew technology such as generative AI.A. Participant DemographicsWe conducted interviews with students (N=12) and instruc-tors (N=6) which resulted in 18 total interviews. Theinstructors included a mix of tenure-track and teaching-trackfaculty. Students were recruited through student organizations,flyers, and snowball sampling. All of the instructors interviewed taughtcomputer science courses. Two researchers followed thisprocess independently, then compared codes in order to helpmitigate interpretation biases. There is currently an urgent need to understand the im-plications of generative AI in computing education. For ex-ample, researchers and practitioners are already raising con-cerns about over-reliance, academic misconduct, and modeltrustworthiness This work serves as an early probeinto understanding current preferences, values, and concerns. While limited in scope, our work provides a preliminaryinvestigation in order to help instructors, researchers, and morequickly adapt to this changing landscape. The participants ofthis study, both instructors and students, came from a singleR1 university and represent a relatively small sample size,and as such, these results may not fully represent differentdemographics across different universities. R ESULTS - THEMES FROM STUDENT INTERVIEWS In this section, we present the themes that emerged from ourstudent interviews. A summarized version of the results frominterviews with both stakeholders (students and instructors)can be found in Figure 1.Within each theme, we present sub-themes, our observations, relevant supporting quotes, and rela- tionships between the theme and our three research questionspresented in the introduction. Despite focusing our questionson Generative AI (GAI) tools such as GitHub Copilot, Codex,and Grammarly, our participants tended to focus on ChatGPT. A. Perceived Benefits of GAI Tools (RQ1)Students shared the ways in which they have found GAITools to be beneficial in their computing courses, as well astheir potential uses in computing education. GAI tools reduce the effort to write code and findlearning materials. Most students (10/12) believed that GAItools, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to become, andin many cases are already, valuable learning tools to reducethe effort for students and instructors to complete somecommon programming tasks and find learning materials. Ofthe remaining two students, one was not very familiar withGAI tools and was therefore unsure of their value and theother actively tried to avoid using them. Students shared a number of ways in which they have foundGAI tools useful in the computing education context:•Generating skeleton or boilerplate code (S2, S3, S8, S9) •Generating explanations of code (S2, S6, S7, S10, S11) Reflecting on how GAI tools can generate examples to sup-plement existing learning materials, S2 said,“[Students] can use [ChatGPT] to find resourcesonline... Students use GAI tools to avoid busy work. When askedwhat motivates students to use these tools, students who fre-quently use them expressed that they were more likely to useGAI tools for assisting with, or even completing, assignmentsthat they perceived as “meaningless” or mere “busy work.” Some students (4/12) compared it to existing tools, such asthe calculator, whose introduction into the classroom allowedstudents to progress towards more advanced topics faster andreduce the amount of time students have to spend on familiartasks or could be considered tedious [46]. According to someof the students, this refers to any work that takes too much oftheir time for very little academic benefit or that they aren’tpassionate about. Participant S2 remarked on what kind ofwork they use ChatGPT for the most, saying,“ChatGPT could just kind of do all the busy workor anything I could figure out, in like a couple ofminutes. GAI tools shift the focus to higher levels of abstraction. Students expressed (6/12) that GAI tools could help reduce theamount of time spent working at lower levels of abstraction. Students often gave examples of how GAI tools could shift thelearner’s focus toward higher-level skills (e.g., design, the anal-ysis and evaluation of code, or advanced software engineeringconcepts) which students are more likely to encounter in latercomputing courses. For example, participant S9 described howstudents might focus on design patterns and software designrather than implementation details. On the left, summarized themes from student interviews are presented and, on the right, summarized themes from instructor interviews are presented. “You don’t usually get design patterns until you arein graduate school, right? Unless you’d specificallyseek it out...we could use ChatGPT to help teachdesign patterns where... You can use ChatGPT as atool to implement all the little pieces. But we aregoing to try to break down this larger problem tofigure out what pattern applies to it, and then usewhatever you need to use to generate the individualpieces of code. But we really care about the overallstructure and making sure that the students kindof have this broader understanding of the piece ofsoftware rather than a single algorithm or a singlepiece of code or a smaller scale program. ” GAI tools provide alternative perspectives and sourcesof assistance. Another common theme amongst students whoregularly use GAI tools is that these tools provide anothersource of assistance outside and their instructors and teachingassistants (4/12). Some reasons why students said they chooseto use a tool such as ChatGPT rather than asking theirinstructors or teaching assistants are:•Some professors are not good at explaining course con-cepts and code (S4, S5)•GAI tools can provide multiple and alternative perspec-tives about programming concepts (S5, S10) •GAI tools can be more convenient sources of assistanceover instructors or TAs (S5, S8) S4 described a time in which they wished they were able touse GAI tools in order to get more help with a concept inone of their computing courses, especially when they foundthemselves searching for a different perspective when they felttheir instructor wasn’t communicating what they needed,“With some professors, they don’t know how tocommunicate the answer that you’re looking for...I had a lot of trouble wrapping my head around itwhen I asked in what context will we use a linkedlist. [My Instructor] just explained what a linkedlist was, and with ChatGPT, I feel like I could say,‘give me an example of a linked list and how I wouldimplement it in this language, ’ ” B. Concerns about GAI Tools (RQ2) While students largely expressed excitement about GAItools’ benefits to computing education , students also expressedan amount of trepidation and concern regarding their use incomputing education. Concerns about over-reliance. Most students (9/12) men-tioned the potential for students to develop an over-relianceon these tools as a concern. More specifically, students (6/12)detailed their concerns about the quality of education studentsreceive if they become over-reliant on GAI tools that don’tadequately explain their responses. Some of the specific con-cerns about over-reliance and the quality of education were:•Students may not develop an understanding of the ma-terial when they get assistance from GAI tools (S1, S4,S5, S9, S11, S12) The following quotes from participants further illustrate someof these student concerns. Participant S1 said,“When using them I don’t really fully understandwhat they’re telling me, and it’s just kind of like,‘Oh! But I’m not really the onelearning and really digesting what’s happening andhow I got to that conclusion. ” Participant S4 provided an additional perspective, saying,“I feel like a lot of people just heavily rely on it, andthey use it to just copy and paste the work, and notnecessarily understand why. I feel like they wouldjust copy the work given to them. It kind of ruinsthe purpose of learning it in the first place. ” Concerns about trustworthiness. The majority of students(7/12) also expressed concerns about the trustworthiness ofthe output given by GAI tools. Students raised concerns aboutthe reliability of information generated by these models dueto their potential to misinform students. Specifically, studentsoutlined the following concerns about trustworthiness:•Information sources are missing or incorrect (S1, S8, S9) •GAI tools tend to hallucinate information (S6, S8, S10)•Students have to double-check everything, not just infor-mation, but things like false context and tone (S4, S6)Participant S8 said, due to these models’ tendency to hal-lucinate students have to be careful to double-check theinformation they receive,“[ChatGPT] is helpful, but I understand that some-times it also hallucinates as well. I don’t really know if it is yetlike a Google replacement..., I feel like it’s only asuseful if you really know the topic that you’re talkingabout, and like you can read what it’s saying, and besure that it’s not like [meaningless output], becausesometimes you do have to search again on Googlejust to make sure what it said is correct. ” Participant S4 also described needing to check responses forcorrectness, sharing that it wouldn’t stop them from using GAItools altogether and it prevents them from relying on the toolstoo much,“[Incorrect ChatGPT responses] wouldn’t keep mefrom using it again. It’s just a small detail. Concerns about academic integrity. These students expressed the belief that the amount of plagia-rism will increase as these tools become more popular. However, students did not necessarily believe that AI-aidedplagiarism is all that different from plagiarism that occurredpreviously. Students claimed that the only difference betweenplagiarizing by copying someone else’s work or paying fora subscription service such as Chegg and using a tool likeChatGPT is that it’s free and available to everyone. “Before I’ve seen people use things like, Chegg, tojust straight up just finish their homework. I feel likeit’s just a difference between you using ChatGPT,which is a free service, and it can give you theinformation you want, and you could probably justchange up a couple of things with it versus payinga fee for a subscription-based service that just hoststhe work that your professors are giving to you. ” (S4)C. Predicted Implications of GAI Tools (RQ3) Students were excited to share their insight about howcourse curricula and assessment methodologies should beadapted to accommodate GAI tools. Instructors are responsible for adapting their courses. Inour interviews, none of the students said that instructors shouldban the use of GAI tools. On the contrary, multiple students(5/12) expressed that instructors are responsible for adaptingtheir courses in ways to work with this new technology, asinstructors have had to in the past with any innovative andpopular technology, such as calculators, Wikipedia, and theInternet (4/12). While the majority of students expressed thatthey were not sure exactly what steps need to be taken byinstructors in order to adapt their classes, a couple of studentsindicated updates they hope instructors do notmake to theirclasses. However,both students said they would not want this,“I guess they would have to possibly lower labweights and maybe increase exam weights, or youknow things that can be more so tested in person... Ifeel like it shouldn’t be like that... I kind of had thebenefit of, like, you know, being able to use Google,having like a 40-50% like lab weight. Being able touse Google, learn, read a lot of documentation, andyou know, actually, kind of somewhat suffer throughlabs, but also I knew that the lab grade would saveme because I wasn’t as good on exams, ” (S8) Instructors must focus on student engagement. Severalstudents (3/12) specifically mentioned that, when learning newmaterial, hands-on active-learning assignments are the mosthelpful and engaging. Students (4/12) emphasized that theybelieved that engaging courses and coursework would morelikely result in engaged students who see value in and wantto complete the assignments and are less likely to plagiarize. Participant S1 said the following,“Instructors need to understand why students useChatGPT in the first place, and some of the reasonswhy they use it is they just don’t understand thecontent, and they want an easy out and that meansthat something is going wrong with the curriculumthat’s being presented to them. ” Instructors should incorporate GAI tools into the classes. Students were excited about the potential for instructors toinclude these models in their curricula. Students suggestedthat instructors could focus less on implementation detailsand more on high-level concepts. Participant S5 pointed tothe importance of other skills that should be learned in earlyprogramming courses, particularly problem-solving. “I think learning the language is the easiest part, but I think the introductory programming coursesoffer something a little bit more important, which isproblem-solving. Which I think will still ... be a veryimportant part of programming, because that’s reallyall programming is. It’s just problem-solving... Butthe problem-solving mindset is definitely somethingthat cannot just be assumed people have. ” Students (4/12) also suggested that instructors could teachstudents how to use GAI tools by teaching students the bestways to prompt tools such as ChatGPT and the limitationsand risks of using these tools. A couple of students alsosuggested instructors could use GAI tools to scaffold learning,as described in more detail by participant S5,“It’s like asking a mathematician to do mundanerepetitive math equations today without a calcula-tor... Notreally. So, I think instructors should, you know, startoff teaching their students, you know, how to do it. How to do everything without an AI language modelto help them. And then, as they get more advancedwith it, they, you know, introduce the AI to just, youknow, make the more difficult tasks a bit easier. ” The following section details the themes and observationsdiscovered through our instructor interviews. Similar to stu-dents, instructors tended to focus primarily on ChatGPT. A. Perceived Benefits of GAI Tools (RQ1) While instructors (5/6) have not used GAI tools frequently,they envision a number of ways in which they can be beneficialfor students in computing courses. Overall, instructors werefamiliar with GAI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot,but used them much less than students. Consequently, theyhad fewer insights about they might be used in the computingeducation context. However, every instructor (6/6) thought thatthese tools could be valuable for students. GAI tools can help students understand code and com-puting concepts. A couple of instructors (2/6) thought thatGAI tools were beneficial for students when they encounterunfamiliar code and that GAI tools could provide just-in-timesupport. While prior work has demonstrated the ability ofgenerative AI to explain code, participant I2 described how thishelps students when they encounter unfamiliar code online,“You can give [ChatGPT] a little piece of a programyou got from Github or whatever, and have it explainto you what this code is doing, and it would do agood job. ” GAI tools can help students find inspiration, brainstorm,and get feedback on ideas. A majority of the instructors(4/6) detailed ways in which GAI tools could be used to aidin creative processes such as ideation and brainstorming. Forexample, participant I1 described how GAI tools can helpwith brainstorming solutions to coding problems. Additionally,some instructors (2/6) described ways in which they’ve foundsuccess in having GAI tools, specifically ChatGPT, providestudents with feedback on their writing for project-basedcomputing courses. Participant I2 described how they’ve hadstudents use ChatGPT to try to find weaknesses or areas ofimprovement for their essays or project proposals. GAI tools’ low cost and accessibility can provide stu-dents with high quality learning resources. A couple ofinstructors (2/6) expressed their excitement about how the lowcost and barrier to entry can provide students with resourcesthat can be prohibitively expensive, such as private tutors orpaid services such as Chegg or CourseHero. Additionally, GAItools could act as high quality learning resources outside ofstudents’ instructors and TAs, providing another perspectiveon course topics. B. Concerns about GAI Tools (RQ2)Instructors hold many common concerns regarding AI sys-tems for the use of generative AI in computing education andtheir use by students. Concerns about trustworthiness. Most of the instructors(5/6) cited the lack of trustworthiness of responses from GAItools as one of their primary concerns. All of the instructorsmentioned that it’s important to double-check the informa-tion received from these models. However, as one instructorpointed out, students don’t always have the necessary foun-dational knowledge to know whether the outputs are right orwrong. Participant I4 said,“We don’t know that [ChatGPT] is giving [students]the right information. and you know, if I know atopic, I know when I’m getting bogus information. They don’t, you know, so that’s a concern. ” Concerns about over-reliance. Several instructors (3/6)also cited over-reliance as a significant concern when consid-ering students using these models in their classes. ParticipantI3 expressed concern about students not fully learning materialif they rely too heavily on GAI tools. Participants I1 andI3 both expressed concern that students may lose importantskills, such as writing, if they become too reliant on thesemodels. Participant I5 discussed their concern about GAI toolsreplacing students’ own effort, saying,“I think pedagogically, we’ll have to kind of go backto the drawing board. Not necessarily just to prevent studentsfrom using and benefiting from these tools, by allmeans we should embrace change and new methodsand new ways of doing things. So find ways wherestudents can use these things to assist, to help butnot one where it replaces their own cognitive load. ” Concerns about academic integrity. All instructors (6/6) ex- pressed concern about students using GAI tools to plagiarize. Several instructors (4/6) expressed that, due to the availabilityand low cost of tools like ChatGPT, students are likely toplagiarize more. However, one instructor (I5) said,“I feel like a student who was never motivatedto cheat in the first place will not do it now justbecause ChatGPT is available. Sufficiently motivatedstudents would have always cheated. So if I were tolazily assume that there is an uptick in the numberof students who are now exploiting this tool oran uptick in the number of students who are nowcheating as a result of this tool, it would havebeen those in the middle who were always willingto, but perhaps lack the time, resources, access,or the know-how to properly engage in it, but Idon’t think just there’s this giant movement towardsmore students doing it, who would not have doneit otherwise. I don’t think it’s turning students intocheaters. I think it’s just making it more accessibleto those who already would have done it. ” This participant’s insight aligns with the perspectives sharedby the other instructors in that, the concerns about academicintegrity which have arisen due to the presence of GAI tools inthe classroom, are less focused on just stopping students fromcheating, which is unlikely, but rather in developing ways inwhich instructors can disincentivize cheating. C. Predicted Implications of GAI Tools (RQ3)Instructors shared uncertainty about what exactly needs tochange in course designs and assessment methods; however,they emphasized the importance of proactively incorporatingthese models into computing education curricula. GAI tools should be incorporated into classrooms. Unanimously, instructors (6/6) emphasized that they believeGAI tools should not be banned, and they should embracetheir existence and include them in the classroom. Instructorsbelieved it was imperative to understand how these tools work. Some of the ways they envisioned incorporating GAI tools intotheir courses included:•Let students use it but they should be able to explain whythe output is correct or incorrect (I1, I3, I6)•Clearly articulate what students need to know how to dowithout using GAI tools (I4)Participant I4, detailed how, with any new tools which shifthow courses are taught, clear expectations for students needto be established,“... before calculators were a thing we used to expectstudents to memorize multiplication and divisiontables. And you know, after the calculator cameinto being, of course, you know it’s reasonable notto expect people to memorize that when you knowthey’ve got a tool that they can use to figure outhow to multiply things, you know. And I could seethe same thing happening with us with programmingnow that tools like ChatGPT exist, you know, maybethere are certain things that we could expect studentsto use a tool for, and we don’t have to test them onit. But at the same time, you know, there has to besome core level of knowledge that we should expectfrom a student, you know, without the use of tools. ” GAI tools can facilitate critical thinking A couple ofinstructors (2/6) were excited about the potential to use thesemodels in their courses to help students further develop theircritical thinking and analysis skills. Participant I6 said,“ Let them actually use ChatGPT to come back witha report as a first draft. So in that sense, it is more useful for thestudent to develop their critical thinking... instead ofjust like the old way of just writing a report. ” It’snot, give me code, it’s, here is some code, give mesome sort of analysis that matches or fits into some-thing that is not easily template-tized, something thatis not easily described or describable. ” Instructors need to update assessment methods. In termsof how to update curriculum to adapt courses to account forthe existence of these models, instructors did not have a veryclear idea of what exactly needed to be done, with manyexpressing uncertainty about the best way to assess studentprogress, prevent plagiarism, and ensure that students do notrely too heavily on the models, hindering their education. Intheir interviews, instructors did mention a few considerationsthey had for updating their assessment methods:•Mitigate plagiarism by developing engaging assignmentsand reducing busy work (I3)•Change course grade weights such that easily plagiarizedassignments can’t carry students’ grades (I4, I5) D ISCUSSION & C ONCLUSIONA. Converging Themes across Stakeholders and Opportunities In this section, we present converging themes that emergedthrough our stakeholder interviews. Based on these areas ofconvergence, we present some opportunities to maximize thebenefits of generative models in computing education settings. 1) Students and instructors are concerned about trustwor-thiness and over-reliance: Across most interviews, studentsand instructors were concerned about the trustworthiness ofGAI tools as well as the potential for students to become over-reliant on them. Participants highlighted the black-box natureof GAI and their tendency to hallucinate non-factual informa-tion. This raised concerns about students not understandingthe responses they receive from GAI, a lack of reliability ofthe information received, and the impact of over-reliance onstudents’ learning outcomes. Opportunity #1: Explicitly teach students when and how touse GAI tools. Educators can teach courses and modules abouthow to fact-check the model’s output in cases where the modelis known to perform poorly; calibrating a healthy skepticismin generative AI. Additionally, instructors should not assumecomputing students have AI literacy. It may be necessary toteach courses in computational thinking and AI literacy [47]. 2) Students and instructors believe GAI tools will broadenaccess: Students expressed that they believed tools like Chat-GPT are valuable learning tools, partially due to the fact thatit’s available at any time and it’s free or inexpensive to use. Opportunity #2: GAI tools democratize access to help. Similarto when unequal access to the Internet caused some students tobe left behind [15], today, unequal financial access to tutors,unpaid internships, college prep programs, and paid contentcan have similar effects. GAI tools may offer cheaper accessto high-quality tutoring. B. Diverging Themes across Stakeholders and Challenges In this section, we present some diverging themes whichhave the potential to cause tension between students andinstructors. We also describe how these divergences in prefer-ences may eventually lead to challenges. 1) Students tended to be more familiar and frequent usersof GAI tools than instructors: The majority of the studentswere either familiar with the capabilities of GAI tools or usethem frequently. On the contrary, some instructors had triedGAI tools, but they did not use them very frequently. Challenge #1: Instructors need to become familiar withthe functionality and limitations of GAI tools in order toadapt curricula and assessment methods adequately. Currently,instructors are at a disadvantage to students who are muchmore familiar with these models. 2) Students and instructors are not aligned on how to adaptassessment: While both stakeholders expressed uncertaintyabout how to adapt assessment methods to account for GAItools, the suggestions they did provide did not align. Studentsemphasized that the weight and frequency of hands-on, activelearning assignments, such as programming labs, should notchange as they are valuable to students’ comprehension of newmaterial and learning goals. A few of the instructors proposedto adapt their assessment methods to combat academic dishon-esty by reducing the weight of some of the lab assignmentsand increasing the weight or frequency of in-class, proctoredassignments, such as quizzes or tests. This divergence betweenthe values of students and instructors has the potential to createsignificant tension between students and instructors. Challenge #2: Instructors wanted to develop assessmentsthat mitigate academic dishonesty. One-third of interviewedinstructors suggested doing this by increasing the weightof proctored exams. However, students expressed that theystill want hands-on and active learning assignments (e.g.,programming lab assignments) to represent a larger portionof their overall grade, because, as many students expressed,they learned better when they were engaged in the tasks theyhad to complete. Increasing the frequency or weight of in-class proctored exams moves away from evidence-based activelearning [48], additionally it may negatively affect students. 3) Instructors were not aware of students’ motivations forusing GAI tools: Students shared a variety of reasons as towhy they would choose to use GAI tools to assist with or com-plete their assignments, such as reducing busy work, gettinganother perspective other than their instructor on a concept,and getting help when their instructor is not available. Wheninstructors were asked to consider why students use thesemodels, the only common response was regarding studentsusing GAI tools for busy work. Challenge #3: Instructors need to better understand stu-dents’ motivations for using GAI tools. Without this un-derstanding, instructors could potentially make changes topedagogy and assessment that unintentionally harm students. To address this concern, researchers and practitioners couldco-design solutions with students. Co-design is useful for cur-riculum design [49] and has already been used for integratingAI into classrooms [50]. These techniques may not only resultin better, more equitable solutions but also have the potentialto build relationships and leverage students’ deeper familiaritywith these GAI tools. C. ConclusionThis paper presents the first systematic investigation of bothstudents’ and instructors’ experiences with and preferencesfor using GAI tools in computing classrooms. While theseresults are preliminary, we believe that rapidly disseminatingthese critical views can guide researchers to capitalize onopportunities while mitigating potential challenges.

Carefully account-ability. They havealso led to the creation of new conferences that focus onfairness, accountability, and transparency. For instance, XAI has grappled withquestions like explainable to who and for what purpose [28].

This qualitative research method is oftenused to elicit participants’ perceptions, experiences, and valuesregarding a particular topic or technology [35].

I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tellthem, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won\\'t allowme. They cry: \"Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" After the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothyhas become a firm fixture in these Oz stories. The little ones all loveDorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn\\'t a realOz story without her.\" So here she is again, as sweet and gentle andinnocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange adventure. There were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more aboutthe Wizard.\" It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in thefirst Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself\"a humbug.\" The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in aballoon and they were all waiting for him to come down again. So whatcould I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"? You willfind him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before. There was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible todo in this present book: they bade me introduce Toto, Dorothy\\'s littleblack dog, who has many friends among my readers. But you will see, whenyou begin to read the story, that Toto was in Kansas while Dorothy wasin California, and so she had to start on her adventure without him. Inthis book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog;but in the next Oz book, if I am permitted to write one, I intend totell a good deal about Toto\\'s further history. Princess Ozma, whom I love as much as my readers do, is again introducedin this story, and so are several of our old friends of Oz. You willalso become acquainted with Jim the Cab-Horse, the Nine Tiny Piglets,and Eureka, the Kitten. I am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved asshe ought to have been; but perhaps she wasn\\'t brought up properly. Dorothy found her, you see, and who her parents were nobody knows. Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while Iread the tender, loving, appealing letters that come to me in almostevery mail from my little readers. I try to answer every letter of my young correspondents; yet sometimesthere are so many letters that a little time must pass before you getyour answer. But be patient, friends, for the answer will surely come,and by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task ofpreparing these books.

As it came to a stop theconductor called out in a loud voice:\"Hugson\\'s Siding!\"At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of thecar, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cagecovered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tuckedunder her arm. The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappearedaround a curve; then she turned to see where she was. The shed at Hugson\\'s Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, anddid not look very inviting. As she peered through the soft gray lightnot a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any personin sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggystanding near a group of trees a short distance away. She walked towardit and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with itshead hanging down almost to the ground. It was a big horse, tall andbony, with long legs and large knees and feet. Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw aboy curled up on the seat, fast asleep. She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. he said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"\"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinkinggray eyes. \"Have you come to take me to Hugson\\'s Ranch? \"\"Of course,\" he answered. \"Train in?\"\"I couldn\\'t be here if it wasn\\'t,\" she said. He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping out ofthe buggy he put Dorothy\\'s suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage onthe floor in front. \"Canary-birds?\" he asked. \"Oh, no; it\\'s just Eureka, my kitten. I thought that was the best way tocarry her. \"The boy nodded. \"Eureka\\'s a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked. \"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained. \"Uncle Henrysays \\'Eureka\\' means \\'I have found it.\\' \"\"All right; hop in. Then the boy picked upthe reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\" The horse did not stir. Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of hisdrooping ears, but that was all. \"Gid-dap!\" called the boy, again. The horse stood still. \"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go. \"The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out. \"Guess I\\'m half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse. Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse atonce backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trotdown the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light. \"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy. \"I\\'ve waited atthat station for five hours. \"\"We had a lot of earthquakes,\" said Dorothy. \"Didn\\'t you feel the groundshake?\"\"Yes; but we\\'re used to such things in California,\" he replied. \"Theydon\\'t scare us much. \"[Illustration: DOROTHY POKED THE BOY WITH HER PARASOL.]\"The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew. \"\"Did he? Then it must have happened while I was asleep,\" he said,thoughtfully. \"How is Uncle Henry?\" she enquired, after a pause during which the horsecontinued to trot with long, regular strides. \"He\\'s pretty well. He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit. \"\"Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?\" she asked. \"Yes. Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry\\'s wife\\'s sister; so wemust be second cousins,\" said the boy, in an amused tone. \"I work forUncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and myboard. \"\"Isn\\'t that a great deal?\" she asked, doubtfully. \"Why, it\\'s a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me. I\\'m a splendidworker. I work as well as I sleep,\" he added, with a laugh. \"What is your name?\" asked Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy\\'s mannerand the cheery tone of his voice. \"Not a very pretty one,\" he answered, as if a little ashamed. \"My wholename is Zebediah; but folks just call me \\'Zeb.\\' You\\'ve been toAustralia, haven\\'t you? \"\"Yes; with Uncle Henry,\" she answered. \"We got to San Francisco a weekago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson\\'s Ranch for a visit while Istayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met. \"\"How long will you be with us?\" he asked. Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas. We\\'ve been away for a long time, you know, and so we\\'re anxious to gethome again. \"The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and lookedthoughtful. Next minute therewas a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the groundopen in a wide crack and then come together again. \"Goodness!\" she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat. \"\"That was an awful big quake,\" replied Zeb, with a white face. \"Italmost got us that time, Dorothy.\"The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock. Then the boy crackedhis whip and touched the animal\\'s flanks with it, and after a low moanof protest Jim stepped slowly along the road. Neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes. The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds asit swept over the valley. Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split intoanother great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing. Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same. Thesudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think. The horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifyingnoises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments thelittle girl lost consciousness. Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but hewas badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip,expecting every moment would be his last. [Illustration][Illustration]CHAPTER 2. THE GLASS CITYWhen Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not sofast. The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this greatcrack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was about toovertake them at any moment. Crash after crash echoed far above theirheads, as the earth came together where it had split, and stones andchunks of clay rattled around them on every side. These they could notsee, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and Jim screamedalmost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck hisboney body. They did not really hurt the poor horse, because everythingwas falling together; only the stones and rubbish fell faster than thehorse and buggy, which were held back by the pressure of the air, sothat the terrified animal was actually more frightened than he wasinjured. How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,she was so greatly bewildered. But bye and bye, as she stared ahead intothe black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the form ofthe horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his long legssprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space. Also, turningher head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had untilnow remained as still and silent as she herself. Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier. With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head overthe side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from. Far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air. This splendid group of colored suns sent raysdarting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy andZeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the raysbegan to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing moreand more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantlyilluminated. Dorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim\\'s big earsturn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail shouldbe yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes ofa zebra. Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and whose hair waspink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous. \"Isn\\'t it funny?\" she said. The boy was startled and his eyes were big. Dorothy had a green streakthrough the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights cametogether, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright. \"I--I don\\'t s-s-see any-thing funny--\\'bout it!\" he stammered. [Illustration: HORSE, BUGGY AND ALL FELL SLOWLY.]Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of thehorse tipping also. But they continued to fall, all together, and theboy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as theywere before. Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to rollslowly over until they were right side up again. During this time Jimstruggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on findinghimself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone ofvoice:\"Well, that\\'s better!\"Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder. \"Can your horse talk?\" she asked. \"Never knew him to, before,\" replied the boy. \"Those were the first words I ever said,\" called out the horse, who hadoverheard them, \"and I can\\'t explain why I happened to speak then. Thisis a nice scrape you\\'ve got me into, isn\\'t it? \"\"As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,\" answered Dorothy,cheerfully. \"But never mind; something will happen pretty soon. \"\"Of course,\" growled the horse; \"and then we shall be sorry ithappened. All this was so terrible and unreal that he could notunderstand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid. Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed closebeside them. There was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they hadpassed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercingrays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again. \"We\\'ve got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deepsigh. \"\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy. \"We are somewhere in the middle of theearth, and the chances are we\\'ll reach the other side of it before long. But it\\'s a big hollow, isn\\'t it? \"\"Awful big!\" answered the boy. \"We\\'re coming to something now,\" announced the horse. At this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and lookeddown. Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away, either. Here and there weregroups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they sparkledso brightly. \"I\\'m sure we are in no danger,\" said Dorothy, in a sober voice. \"\"We\\'ll never get home again, though!\" declared Zeb, with a groan. \"Oh, I\\'m not so sure of that,\" replied the girl. \"The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soonboth were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread outbelow them. They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a bigcity which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharp-pointedspires. These spires were like great spear-points, and if they tumbledupon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury. Jim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straightup with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense. Butno; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a stopat last. When Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beast\\'s legstrembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at once leaped outof the buggy to the roof, and he was so awkward and hasty that he kickedover Dorothy\\'s birdcage, which rolled out upon the roof so that thebottom came off. At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage, satdown upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round eyes. \"Oh,\" said Dorothy. \"\"First time I ever saw a pink cat,\" said Zeb. \"Eureka isn\\'t pink; she\\'s white. \"\"Where\\'s my milk?\" asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy\\'s face. \"\"Oh, Eureka! Can you talk?\"\"Talk! Good gracious, I believe I am. Isn\\'t it funny? \"asked the kitten. \"It\\'s all wrong,\" said Zeb, gravely. \"Animals ought not to talk. Buteven old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident. \"\"I can\\'t see that it\\'s wrong,\" remarked Jim, in his gruff tones. \"Atleast, it isn\\'t as wrong as some other things. What\\'s going to become ofus now? \"\"I don\\'t know,\" answered the boy, looking around him curiously. The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparentthat one could look through the walls as easily as though a window. Dorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms usedfor rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of queerforms huddled into the corners of these rooms. The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces ofglass were lying scattered in every direction. The rainbow tints from the coloredsuns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings manydelicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see. But not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers hadarrived, except that of their own voices. There wasno expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet hemust have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had restedupon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked rapidly tothe furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his shoulder togaze at the strange animal. cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did notlook where he was going; \"be careful, or you\\'ll fall off! He reached the edge of the tallroof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as calmlyas if he were on firm ground. The girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof, andsaw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground. Soon hereached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into one ofthe glass buildings. \"How strange!\" she exclaimed, drawing a long breath. \"Yes; but it\\'s lots of fun, if it _is_ strange,\" remarked the smallvoice of the kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in theair a foot or so away from the edge of the roof. \"Come back, Eureka!\" she called, in distress, \"you\\'ll certainly bekilled. \"\"I have nine lives,\" said the kitten, purring softly as it walked aroundin a circle and then came back to the roof; \"but I can\\'t lose even oneof them by falling in this country, because I really couldn\\'t manage tofall if I wanted to. \"\"Does the air bear up your weight?\" asked the girl. \"Of course; can\\'t you see?\" and again the kitten wandered into the airand back to the edge of the roof. \"It\\'s wonderful!\" said Dorothy. \"Suppose we let Eureka go down to the street and get some one to helpus,\" suggested Zeb, who had been even more amazed than Dorothy at thesestrange happenings. \"Perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves,\" replied the girl. Zeb drew back with a shiver. \"I wouldn\\'t dare try,\" he said. \"May be Jim will go,\" continued Dorothy, looking at the horse. \"And may be he won\\'t!\" answered Jim. \"I\\'ve tumbled through the air longenough to make me contented on this roof. \"\"But we didn\\'t tumble to the roof,\" said the girl; \"by the time wereached here we were floating very slowly, and I\\'m almost sure we couldfloat down to the street without getting hurt. Eureka walks on the airall right. \"\"Eureka weighs only about half a pound,\" replied the horse, in ascornful tone, \"while I weigh about half a ton. \"\"You don\\'t weigh as much as you ought to, Jim,\" remarked the girl,shaking her head as she looked at the animal. \"You\\'re dreadfullyskinny. \"\"Oh, well; I\\'m old,\" said the horse, hanging his head despondently, \"andI\\'ve had lots of trouble in my day, little one. \"\"He eats enough to get fat, I\\'m sure,\" said the boy, gravely. Can you remember any breakfast that I\\'ve had today?\" \"None of us has had breakfast,\" said the boy; \"and in a time of dangerlike this it\\'s foolish to talk about eating. \"\"Nothing is more dangerous than being without food,\" declared the horse,with a sniff at the rebuke of his young master; \"and just at present noone can tell whether there are any oats in this queer country or not. Ifthere are, they are liable to be glass oats! \"[Illustration: \"COME ON, JIM! IT\\'S ALL RIGHT.\"]\"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Dorothy. But I wish we could finda way to get to the ground. \"\"Why don\\'t you walk down?\" asked Eureka. \"I\\'m as hungry as the horse is, \"\"Will you try it, Zeb\" asked the girl, turning to her companion. But he did notwish the little girl to think him a coward, so he advanced slowly to theedge of the roof. Dorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let itrest in the air a little over the edge of the roof. Dorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him, and soon they were bothwalking through the air, with the kitten frisking beside them. \"Come on, Jim!\" called the boy. \"It\\'s all right.\" Jim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over, and being a sensiblehorse and quite experienced, he made up his mind that he could go wherethe others did. So, with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of his shorttail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began floatingdownward to the street. \"Well, well!\" said Dorothy, drawing a long breath, \"What a strangecountry this is. There were men and women,but no children at all, and the folks were all beautifully formed andattractively dressed and had wonderfully handsome faces. There was notan ugly person in all the throng, yet Dorothy was not especially pleasedby the appearance of these people because their features had no moreexpression than the faces of dolls. They did not smile nor did theyfrown, or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness. They simply stared at the strangers, paying most attention to Jim andEureka, for they had never before seen either a horse or a cat and thechildren bore an outward resemblance to themselves. Pretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in thedark hair just over his forehead. He seemed to be a person of authority,for the others pressed back to give him room. After turning his composedeyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he said to Zeb,who was a little taller than Dorothy:\"Tell me, intruder, was it you who caused the Rain of Stones? \"For a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question. Then,remembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them longbefore they had reached this place, he answered:\"No, sir; we didn\\'t cause anything. \"The man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over thisspeech. Then he asked:\"What is an earthquake?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" said Zeb, who was still confused. But Dorothy, seeinghis perplexity, answered:\"It\\'s a shaking of the earth. In this quake a big crack opened and wefell through--horse and buggy, and all--and the stones got loose andcame down with us. \"The man with the star regarded her with his calm, expressionless eyes. \"The Rain of Stones has done much damage to our city,\" he said; \"and weshall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence. asked the girl. \"That I am not prepared to say. the girl enquired. \"I will lead you to it. Come! \"He turned and walked down the street, and after a moment\\'s hesitationDorothy caught Eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy. The boytook his seat beside her and said: \"Gid-dap, Jim. \"As the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glasscity made way for them and formed a procession in their rear. [Illustration]CHAPTER 3. THE ARRIVAL OF THE WIZARDThe doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse andbuggy to enter, so Zeb drove straight through it and the children foundthemselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful. The people at oncefollowed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room,leaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy thecenter of the hall. \"Come to us, oh, Gwig!\" called the man, in a loud voice. He was formed just aswere the other inhabitants of this land and his clothing only differedfrom theirs in being bright yellow. There was even athorn upon the tip of his nose and he looked so funny that Dorothylaughed when she saw him. The Sorcerer, hearing the laugh, looked toward the little girl withcold, cruel eyes, and his glance made her grow sober in an instant. \"Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secludedLand of the Mangaboos?\" he asked, sternly. \"\\'Cause we couldn\\'t help it ,\" said Dorothy. \"Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack andbreak our houses?\" he continued. \"We didn\\'t,\" declared the girl. \"Prove it!\" cried the Sorcerer. \"We don\\'t have to prove it,\" answered Dorothy, indignantly. \"\"We only know that yesterday came a Rain of Stones upon us, which didmuch damage and injured some of our people. Today came another Rain ofStones, and soon after it you appeared among us. \"\"By the way,\" said the man with the star, looking steadily at theSorcerer, \"you told us yesterday that there would not be a second Rainof Stones. Yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the first. What is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth? \"\"My sorcery does tell the truth!\" declared the thorn-covered man. \"Isaid there would be but one Rain of Stones. This second one was a Rainof People-and-Horse-and-Buggy. And some stones came with them. \"\"Will there be any more Rains?\" asked the man with the star. \"No, my Prince. \"\"Neither stones nor people? \"\"No, my Prince. \"\"Are you sure? \"\"Quite sure, my Prince. \"Just then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Princeafter making a low bow. \"More wonders in the air, my Lord,\" said he. Immediately the Prince and all of his people flocked out of the hallinto the street, that they might see what was about to happen. Dorothyand Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them, but the Sorcererremained calmly in his throne. Far up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon. It was all they could do, for to goaway and leave that strange sight was impossible; nor could they hurryits fall in any way. The earth children were not noticed, being so nearthe average size of the Mangaboos, and the horse had remained in theHouse of the Sorcerer, with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of thebuggy. Dorothy was surprised to find howpatient the people were, for her own little heart was beating rapidlywith excitement. A balloon meant to her some other arrival from thesurface of the earth, and she hoped it would be some one able to assisther and Zeb out of their difficulties. Then a little man jumped out of the basket, took off his tall hat, andbowed very gracefully to the crowd of Mangaboos around him. He was quitean old little man, and his head was long and entirely bald. \"Why,\" cried Dorothy, in amazement, \"it\\'s Oz!\" The little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as shewas. But he smiled and bowed as he answered:\"Yes, my dear; I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. And you are littleDorothy, from Kansas. I remember you very well. \"\"Who did you say it was?\" whispered Zeb to the girl. \"It\\'s the wonderful Wizard of Oz. Haven\\'t you heard of him? \"Just then the man with the star came and stood before the Wizard. \"Sir,\" said he, \"why are you here, in the Land of the Mangaboos?\"\"Didn\\'t know what land it was, my son,\" returned the other, with apleasant smile; \"and, to be honest, I didn\\'t mean to visit you when Istarted out. I live on top of the earth, your honor, which is far betterthan living inside it; but yesterday I went up in a balloon, and when Icame down I fell into a big crack in the earth, caused by an earthquake. So I continued todescend until I reached this place, and if you will show me a way to getout of it, I\\'ll go with pleasure. \"The Prince had listened with attention. Said he:\"This child, who is from the crust of the earth, like yourself, calledyou a Wizard. Is not a Wizard something like a Sorcerer? \"\"It\\'s better,\" replied Oz, promptly. \"One Wizard is worth threeSorcerers. \"\"Ah, you shall prove that,\" said the Prince. \"We Mangaboos have, at thepresent time, one of the most wonderful Sorcerers that ever was pickedfrom a bush; but he sometimes makes mistakes. \"\"Never!\" declared the Wizard, boldly. \"Oh, Oz!\" said Dorothy; \"you made a lot of mistakes when you were in themarvelous Land of Oz.\"\"Nonsense!\" said the little man, turning red--although just then a rayof violet sunlight was on his round face. \"Come with me,\" said the Prince to him. \"I wish you to meet ourSorcerer. \"The Wizard did not like this invitation, but he could not refuse toaccept it. So he followed the Prince into the great domed hall, andDorothy and Zeb came after them, while the throng of people trooped inalso. \"What an absurd creature!\" he exclaimed. \"He may look absurd,\" said the Prince, in his quiet voice; \"but he is anexcellent Sorcerer. The only fault I find with him is that he is sooften wrong. \"\"I am never wrong,\" answered the Sorcerer. \"Only a short time ago you told me there would be no more Rain of Stonesor of People,\" said the Prince. \"Well, what then?\"\"Here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong. \"\"One person cannot be called \\'people,\\'\" said the Sorcerer. \"If twoshould come out of the sky you might with justice say I was wrong; butunless more than this one appears I will hold that I was right. \"\"Very clever,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head as if pleased. \"I amdelighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top ofit. \"\"No,\" said the Sorcerer. \"You ought to join one,\" declared the little man seriously. It\\'s a fine aggregation, I assure you. \"\"What do you do?\" asked the Sorcerer. But never mind. It isn\\'t everybodywho gets a chance to see your Land of the Gabazoos. \"\"Mangaboos,\" said the Sorcerer, correcting him. \"If you are a Wizard youought to be able to call people by their right names. \"\"Oh, I\\'m a Wizard; you may be sure of that. Just as good a Wizard as youare a Sorcerer. \"\"That remains to be seen,\" said the other. \"If you are able to prove that you are better,\" said the Prince to thelittle man, \"I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain. Otherwise--\"\"What will happen otherwise?\" asked the Wizard. \"I will stop you from living, and forbid you to be planted,\" returnedthe Prince. \"That does not sound especially pleasant,\" said the little man, lookingat the one with the star uneasily. \"But never mind. I\\'ll beat OldPrickly, all right. \"\"My name is Gwig,\" said the Sorcerer, turning his heartless, cruel eyesupon his rival. \"Let me see you equal the sorcery I am about toperform. \"He waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard,playing sweet music. Yet, look where she would, Dorothy could discoverno bells at all in the great glass hall. The Mangaboo people listened, but showed no great interest. It was oneof the things Gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer. Now was the Wizard\\'s turn, so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked:\"Will somebody kindly loan me a hat?\"No one did, because the Mangaboos did not wear hats, and Zeb had losthis, somehow, in his flight through the air. \"Ahem!\" said the Wizard, \"will somebody please loan me a handkerchief? \"Very good,\" remarked the Wizard. \"I\\'ll use my own hat, if you please. Now, good people, observe me carefully. You see, there is nothing up mysleeve and nothing concealed about my person. He took off his hat and held it upside down, shaking itbriskly. \"Let me see it,\" said the Sorcerer. He took the hat and examined it carefully, returning it afterward to theWizard. \"Now,\" said the little man, \"I will create something out of nothing. \"He placed the hat upon the glass floor, made a pass with his hand, and then removed the hat, displaying a little white piglet no bigger than amouse, which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squealin a tiny, shrill voice. The people watched it intently, for they had never seen a pig before,big or little. He placed one upon the floor, so that it could run around, and pulledapart the other, making three piglets in all; and then one of these waspulled apart, making four piglets. \"Now,\" said the Wizard of Oz, \"having created something from nothing, Iwill make something nothing again. And so, one by one, the nine tinypiglets were pushed together until but a single one of the creaturesremained. When he removed his hat the last piglet had disappearedentirely. The little man gave a bow to the silent throng that had watched him, andthen the Prince said, in his cold, calm voice:\"You are indeed a wonderful Wizard, and your powers are greater thanthose of my Sorcerer. \"\"He will not be a wonderful Wizard long,\" remarked Gwig. \"Because I am going to stop your breath,\" was the reply. \"The little man looked troubled. \"How long will it take you to stop my breath?\" he asked. I\\'m going to begin now. \"He began making queer signs and passes toward the Wizard; but the littleman did not watch him long. Dorothy screamed and expected to see a terrible sight; but as the twohalves of the Sorcerer fell apart on the floor she saw that he had nobones or blood inside of him at all, and that the place where he was cutlooked much like a sliced turnip or potato. cried the Wizard, astonished. \"Of course,\" said the Prince. \"We are all vegetable, in this country. \"\"No,\" answered the Wizard. \"People on top of the earth are all meat. Will your Sorcerer die? Sowe must plant him at once, that other Sorcerers may grow upon his bush,\"continued the Prince. \"What do you mean by that?\" asked the little Wizard, greatly puzzled. \"If you will accompany me to our public gardens,\" replied the Prince, \"Iwill explain to you much better than I can here the mysteries of ourVegetable Kingdom. \"[Illustration: THE WIZARD CUT THE SORCERER EXACTLY IN TWO.] CHAPTER 4. Jim pricked up his ears when he heard they were going to the gardens,and wanted to join the party, thinking he might find something proper toeat; so Zeb put down the top of the buggy and invited the Wizard to ridewith them. The seat was amply wide enough for the little man and the twochildren, and when Jim started to leave the hall the kitten jumped uponhis back and sat there quite contentedly. So the procession moved through the streets, the bearers of the Sorcererfirst, the Prince next, then Jim drawing the buggy with the strangersinside of it, and last the crowd of vegetable people who had no heartsand could neither smile nor frown. The glass city had several fine streets, for a good many people livedthere; but when the procession had passed through these it came upon abroad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks thatflowed through it. There were paths through these gardens, and over someof the brooks were ornamental glass bridges. Dorothy and Zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the Prince,so that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better. \"Who built these lovely bridges?\" asked the little girl. \"No one built them,\" answered the man with the star. \"They grow. \"\"That\\'s queer,\" said she. \"Did the glass houses in your city grow, too?\"\"Of course,\" he replied. \"But it took a good many years for them to growas large and fine as they are now. That is why we are so angry when aRain of Stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs. \"No; but they will grow together again, in time, and we must wait untilthey do. \"They first passed through many beautiful gardens of flowers, which grewnearest the city; but Dorothy could hardly tell what kind of flowersthey were, because the colors were constantly changing under theshifting lights of the six suns. When they passed over a field of grass Jim immediately stretched downhis head and began to nibble. \"A nice country this is,\" he grumbled, \"where a respectable horse has toeat pink grass! \"\"It\\'s violet,\" said the Wizard, who was in the buggy. \"Now it\\'s blue,\" complained the horse. \"As a matter of fact, I\\'m eatingrainbow grass. \"\"How does it taste?\" asked the Wizard. \"Not bad at all,\" said Jim. \"If they give me plenty of it I\\'ll notcomplain about its color. \"By this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field, and thePrince said to Dorothy:\"This is our planting-ground. \"Several Mangaboos came forward with glass spades and dug a hole in theground. After that other people brought water from a brook and sprinkledthe earth. \"He will sprout very soon,\" said the Prince, \"and grow into a largebush, from which we shall in time be able to pick several very goodsorcerers. \"\"Do all your people grow on bushes?\" asked the boy. \"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"Do not all people grow upon bushes whereyou came from, on the outside of the earth. \"\"Not that I ever heard of. \"\"How strange! But if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens Iwill show you the way we grow in the Land of the Mangaboos.\" There were no stairs in their houses, because they did not need them,but on a level surface they generally walked just as we do. The little party of strangers now followed the Prince across a few moreof the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a gardenenclosed by a high hedge. Jim had refused to leave the field of grass,where he was engaged in busily eating; so the Wizard got out of thebuggy and joined Zeb and Dorothy, and the kitten followed demurely attheir heels. This sight explained toDorothy why she had seen no children among the Mangaboos, a thing shehad until now been unable to account for. \"Our people do not acquire their real life until they leave theirbushes,\" said the Prince. So while they grow they cannot be said to really live, andthey must be picked before they can become good citizens. \"\"How long do you live, after you are picked?\" asked Dorothy. \"That depends upon the care we take of ourselves,\" he replied. I\\'ve been picked over six years, but our family is known to beespecially long lived. \"\"Do you eat?\" asked the boy. \"Eat! We are quite solid inside our bodies, and have no needto eat, any more than does a potato. \"\"But the potatoes sometimes sprout,\" said Zeb. \"And sometimes we do,\" answered the Prince; \"but that is considered agreat misfortune, for then we must be planted at once. \"\"Where did you grow?\" asked the Wizard. \"I will show you,\" was the reply. \"Step this way, please. \"This,\" said he, \"is the Royal Bush of the Mangaboos. All of our Princesand Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial. On the central stalk stoodpoised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and solovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thoughtshe had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life. Herflesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressedboth dignity and grace. \"Who is this?\" asked the Wizard, curiously. The Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush. Now heanswered, with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones:\"She is the Ruler destined to be my successor, for she is a RoyalPrincess. \"\"Isn\\'t she ripe now?\" asked Dorothy. \"Not quite,\" said he, finally. \"It will be several days before she needsto be picked, or at least that is my judgment. I am in no hurry toresign my office and be planted, you may be sure. \"\"Probably not,\" declared the Wizard, nodding. \"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives,\"continued the Prince, with a sigh, \"that while we are in our full primewe must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sproutand grow and give birth to other people. \"\"I\\'m sure the Princess is ready to be picked,\" asserted Dorothy, gazinghard at the beautiful girl on the bush. \"\"Never mind,\" answered the Prince, hastily, \"she will be all right for afew days longer, and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose ofyou strangers, who have come to our land uninvited and must be attendedto at once. \"\"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Zeb. \"That is a matter I have not quite decided upon,\" was the reply. \"\"You needn\\'t worry,\" said Dorothy. \"We wouldn\\'t grow under ground, I\\'msure. \"\"But why destroy my friends?\" asked the little Wizard. \"Why not let themlive? \"\"They do not belong here,\" returned the Prince. \"They have no right tobe inside the earth at all. \"\"We didn\\'t ask to come down here; we fell,\" said Dorothy. \"That is no excuse,\" declared the Prince, coldly. The children looked at each other in perplexity, and the Wizard sighed. Eureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft, purring voice:\"He won\\'t need to destroy _me_, for if I don\\'t get something to eatpretty soon I shall starve to death, and so save him the trouble. \"\"If he planted you, he might grow some cat-tails,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Oh, Eureka! perhaps we can find you some milk-weeds to eat,\" said theboy. \"Phoo!\" snarled the kitten; \"I wouldn\\'t touch the nasty things! \"\"You don\\'t need milk, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy; \"you are big enough nowto eat any kind of food. \"\"If I can get it,\" added Eureka. \"I\\'m hungry myself,\" said Zeb. \"But I noticed some strawberries growingin one of the gardens, and some melons in another place. These peopledon\\'t eat such things, so perhaps on our way back they will let us getthem. \"\"Never mind your hunger,\" interrupted the Prince. \"I shall order youdestroyed in a few minutes, so you will have no need to ruin our prettymelon vines and berry bushes. Follow me, please, to meet your doom.\" CHAPTER 5. DOROTHY PICKS THE PRINCESSThe words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not verycomforting, and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure. The children, feeling sad and despondent, were about to follow him whenthe Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder. \"Wait!\" he whispered. \"What for?\" asked the girl. \"Suppose we pick the Royal Princess,\" said the Wizard. \"I\\'m quite sure she\\'s ripe, and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler, andmay treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to. \"\"All right!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly. \"Let\\'s pick her while we havethe chance, before the man with the star comes back. \"So together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized onehand of the lovely Princess. \"Pull!\" cried Dorothy, and as they did so the royal lady leaned towardthem and the stems snapped and separated from her feet. She was not atall heavy, so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to theground. The beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant, tuckedin a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a lookaround the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a sweetbut even toned voice:\"I thank you very much. \"\"We salute your Royal Highness!\" cried the Wizard, kneeling and kissingher hand. Just then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to hasten,and a moment later he returned to the enclosure, followed by a number ofhis people. Instantly the Princess turned and faced him, and when he saw that shewas picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble. \"Sir,\" said the Royal Lady, with much dignity, \"you have wronged megreatly, and would have wronged me still more had not these strangerscome to my rescue. \"\"I did not know that you were ripe,\" answered the Prince, in a lowvoice. \"Give me the Star of Royalty!\" Slowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it uponthat of the Princess. Then all the people bowed low to her, and thePrince turned and walked away alone. What became of him afterward ourfriends never knew. The people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession andmarched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palaceand to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion. But while thepeople in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked inthe air just above their heads, to show that she was a superior beingand more exalted than her subjects. No one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers, so Dorothy andZeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselvesinto the vegetable gardens. This was a very interestingexperience to them, and Dorothy said:\"I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air. \"\"Perhaps,\" answered the Wizard, \"it is because we are close to thecenter of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very slight. \"\"Is this a fairy country?\" asked the boy. \"Of course it is,\" returned Dorothy, promptly. \"Only a fairy countrycould have veg\\'table people; and only in a fairy country could Eurekaand Jim talk as we do. \"\"That\\'s true,\" said Zeb, thoughtfully. But the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat, andcalled the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk bymeans of his magical arts. As they sat upon the grass watching Jim, who was still busily eating,Eureka said:\"I don\\'t believe you are a Wizard at all! \"\"No,\" answered the little man, \"you are quite right. \"\"The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug,\" agreed Dorothy. \"I\\'ve knownhim for a long time. \"\"If that is so,\" said the boy, \"how could he do that wonderful trickwith the nine tiny piglets? \"\"Don\\'t know,\" said Dorothy, \"but it must have been humbug. \"\"Very true,\" declared the Wizard, nodding at her. \"It was necessary todeceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince, as well as their stupidpeople; but I don\\'t mind telling you, who are my friends, that the thingwas only a trick. \"\"But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes!\" exclaimed Zeb. \"So did I,\" purred the kitten. \"To be sure,\" answered the Wizard. \"You saw them because they werethere. They are in my inside pocket now. \"\"Let\\'s see the pigs,\" said Eureka, eagerly. The little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tinypiglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran aroundand nibbled the tender blades. \"They\\'re hungry, too,\" he said. \"Oh, what cunning things!\" cried Dorothy, catching up one and pettingit. said the piglet, with a squeal, \"you\\'re squeezing me! \"\"Dear me!\" murmured the Wizard, looking at his pets in astonishment. \"They can actually talk! \"\"May I eat one of them?\" asked the kitten, in a pleading voice. \"\"Why, Eureka,\" said Dorothy, reproachfully, \"what a cruel question! Itwould be dreadful to eat these dear little things. \"\"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily atthe kitten; \"cats are cruel things. \"\"I\\'m not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning. \"I\\'m just hungry. \"\"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\" declared thelittle man, in a stern voice. \"They are the only things I have to proveI\\'m a wizard. \"\"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy. \"I never saw suchsmall pigs before. \"\"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"whereeverything is small because it\\'s a small island. \"\"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front ofDorothy and looking pleadingly into her face. And if I can\\'t eat thepiglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup. \"\"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in thesebrooks. Do you like fish? \"\"Fish!\" cried the kitten. \"Do I like fish? \"\"Then I\\'ll try to catch you some,\" said he. \"But won\\'t they be veg\\'table, like everything else here?\" asked thekitten. \"I think not. There is no reason, that I can see, why theymay not exist in the waters of this strange country. [Illustration: IN THE GARDEN OF THE MANGABOOS.]The fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifullycut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine itclosely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and ina few moments it had entirely disappeared. \"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones? \"\"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as itwashed its face after the meal. \"\"You were very greedy,\" said the girl. \"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten. The little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene withfrightened eyes. \"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them. said another. \"Don\\'t worry,\" Dorothy murmured, soothingly, \"I\\'ll not let the kittenhurt you. Eureka stuck up her nose at suchfood, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of thecrackers and ate them up in a jiffy. \"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard. \"That is, if Jimhas had enough of the pink grass. \"The cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh. \"I\\'ve tried to eat a lot while I had the chance,\" said he, \"for it\\'slikely to be a long while between meals in this strange country. But I\\'mready to go, now, at any time you wish. \"So, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket,where they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into thebuggy and Jim started back to the town. \"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl. \"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" repliedthe Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that hewould keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princesswon\\'t know but that we belong there. \"It doesn\\'t look very homelike,\" said Dorothy, gazing around at thebare room. \"But it\\'s a place to stay, anyhow. \"\"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to someopenings that appeared near the top of the dome. \"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs toget to them. \"\"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard. \"Let uswalk up, and see where the doors lead to. \"With this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, andDorothy and Zeb followed him. \"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl. \"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied. \"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when wecame, and if there is no sunset there can be no night. \"\"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard. \"But it is a long time since I have hadany sleep, and I\\'m tired. So I think I shall lie down upon one of thesehard glass benches and take a nap. \"\"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of thehall. Then the boy returnedto one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glassbench was soon deep in slumberland. [Illustration]CHAPTER 6. THE MANGABOOS PROVE DANGEROUSWhen the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon theLand of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival. \"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strangecountry, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell. But inthe basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me. There is nothing else that I care about. \"So the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he hadreturned Dorothy was awake. Then the three held a counsel to decide whatthey should do next, but could think of no way to better theircondition. \"I don\\'t like these veg\\'table people,\" said the little girl. \"They\\'recold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness. It is because there is no warm blood in them,\"remarked the Wizard. \"And they have no hearts; so they can\\'t love anyone--not eventhemselves,\" declared the boy. \"The Princess is lovely to look at,\" continued Dorothy, thoughtfully;\"but I don\\'t care much for her, after all. If there was any other placeto go, I\\'d like to go there. \"\"But _is_ there any other place?\" asked the Wizard. \"I don\\'t know,\" she answered. Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them,and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess anda throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer. So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said tothem:\"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we havedecided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must notremain here. \"\"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy. \"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was theanswer. \"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard. \"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\"said the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodiesto make themselves grow bigger. The animals you have with you we willdrive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit. Then our country willbe rid of all its unwelcome visitors. \"\"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one ofthose growing is yet ripe enough to pick. Why destroy me?\"\"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I aminformed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, totake the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for himto be planted. Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able toperform. \"At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick ofproducing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again. He didit very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strangepiglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person couldbe. But afterward she said:\"I have heard of this wonderful magic. But it accomplishes nothing ofvalue. What else can you do?\"The Wizard tried to think. But eventhat did not satisfy the Princess. \"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic bycreating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit aDestroyer much more dreadful than your Clinging Vines.\" So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other andset a lantern upon each of their heads. \"Don\\'t laugh,\" he whispered to them, \"or you will spoil the effect of mymagic. \"[Illustration: \"NOW, PRINCESS,\" EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD.]Then, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkledface, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns. TheMangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen anylight that did not come directly from their suns. Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor,where it covered quite a broad surface. \"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors whowished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step withinthis circle of light. If they advised you well, and were in the right,they will not be injured in any way. But if any advised you wrongly, thelight will wither him. \"The advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commandedthem to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and werescorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that ofbaked potatoes. \"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than anySorcerer we have ever known. As it is evident that my people haveadvised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadfulGarden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into theBlack Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have themaround. \"The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himselfthat he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had goneboth Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit,and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them fromsuch a fate. For two or three days after this--if we call days the periods betweensleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friendswere not disturbed in any way. Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, andwalking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest. They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where shelay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her. The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches andwatched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval. \"Don\\'t be rough!\" Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch coveredwith sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, thekitten and the piglets. \"Here--stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after beingpricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the wayof the thorns. Here were more of thevegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now frightenedcreatures down the street. Jim had to be careful not to step upon thetiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing, whileEureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her, also triedto protect the pretty little things from injury. \"What does all this mean, anyhow?\" asked the horse, jumping to escape athorn. \"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which theythreatened to cast us,\" replied the kitten. \"If I were as big as youare, Jim, I\\'d fight these miserable turnip-roots! \"I\\'d kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs. \"\"All right,\" said the horse; \"I\\'ll do it. Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy andscratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many vegetablecomplexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did the horse. But the foes were too many to be repulsed for long. [Illustration]CHAPTER 7. INTO THE BLACK PIT AND OUT AGAINWhen they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged, towering chunkof deep green glass, and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme. Half way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond thepoint where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it. The Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into thisdark hole and then, having pushed the buggy in after them--for it seemedsome of them had dragged it all the way from the domed hall--they beganto pile big glass rocks within the entrance, so that the prisoners couldnot get out again. \"\"If the Wizard was here,\" said one of the piglets, sobbing bitterly, \"hewould not see us suffer so. \"\"We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked,\"added Eureka. \"But never mind; be brave, my friends, and I will go andtell our masters where you are, and get them to come to your rescue. \"The mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now, but the kitten gave aleap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into theair. Eureka,however, was lighter than the Mangaboos, and while they could mount onlyabout a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could gonearly two hundred feet. So she ran along over their heads until she hadleft them far behind and below and had come to the city and the House ofthe Sorcerer. There she entered in at Dorothy\\'s window in the dome andaroused her from her sleep. As soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened theWizard and Zeb, and at once preparations were made to go to the rescueof Jim and the piglets. Dorothy\\'swicker suit-case was still under the seat of the buggy, and by goodfortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he hadtaken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest. So there wasnothing for the girl to carry but the kitten, which she held close toher bosom and tried to comfort, for its little heart was still beatingrapidly. Before long they neared the Black Pit, where a busy swarm of Mangaboos,headed by their Princess, was engaged in piling up glass rocks beforethe entrance. \"Stop, I command you!\" cried the Wizard, in an angry tone, and at oncebegan pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets. Instead ofopposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made agood-sized hole in the barrier, when by order of the Princess they allsprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns. [Illustration: THROUGH THE BLACK PIT.]Dorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked, and Zeb andthe Wizard, after enduring a few stabs from the thorns, were glad tofollow her. At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glassagain, and as the little man realized that they were all about to beentombed in the mountain he said to the children:\"My dears, what shall we do? Jump out and fight? \"\"What\\'s the use?\" replied Dorothy. \"\"That\\'s the way I feel about it,\" remarked Zeb, rubbing his wounds. \"I\\'ve had enough of the Mangaboos. \"\"All right,\" said the Wizard; \"I\\'m with you, whatever you decide. But wecan\\'t live long in this cavern, that\\'s certain. \"Noticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets,patted each one lovingly on its fat little head, and placed themcarefully in his inside pocket. \"How big is this hole?\" asked Dorothy. \"I\\'ll explore it and see,\" replied the boy. So he carried the lantern back for quite a distance, while Dorothy andthe Wizard followed at his side. The cavern did not come to an end, asthey had expected it would, but slanted upward through the great glassmountain, running in a direction that promised to lead them to the sideopposite the Mangaboo country. \"The others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion, and at once theboy began to harness Jim to the buggy. When all was in readiness thethree took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along theway, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lightedlantern so the horse could see where to go. Jim stopped sometimes to rest, for the climb was rather steepand tiresome. \"We must be nearly as high as the six colored suns, by this time,\" saidDorothy. \"I didn\\'t know this mountain was so tall. \"\"We are certainly a good distance away from the Land of the Mangaboos,\"added Zeb; \"for we have slanted away from it ever since we started. The sides ofthe tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, andthe floor became more level. [Illustration]CHAPTER 8. THE VALLEY OF VOICESBy journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightfulvalley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with anotherrugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and prettygreen hills at the ends. Several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticedtwo very singular and unusual facts about this valley. The second and even more singular fact was the absence ofany inhabitant of this splendid place. From their elevated position theycould overlook the entire valley, but not a single moving object couldthey see. The mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar togranite. The nearest cottage was still some distanceaway. \"Isn\\'t it fine?\" cried Dorothy, in a joyous voice, as she sprang out ofthe buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass. \"Yes, indeed!\" answered Zeb. \"We were lucky to get away from thosedreadful vegetable people. \"\"It wouldn\\'t be so bad,\" remarked the Wizard, gazing around him, \"if wewere obliged to live here always. We couldn\\'t find a prettier place, I\\'msure. \"He took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass, andJim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was verycontented in his new surroundings. \"We can\\'t walk in the air here, though,\" called Eureka, who had tried itand failed; but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground, and theWizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth than they hadbeen in the Mangaboo country, for everything was more homelike andnatural. \"But where are the people?\" asked Dorothy. The little man shook his bald head. \"Can\\'t imagine, my dear,\" he replied. They heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find thecreature anywhere. Thefruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant, and looked so appetizingand delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed:\"What is it, do you s\\'pose?\"The piglets had smelled the fruit quickly, and before the girl couldreach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones hadrushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness. \"It\\'s good, anyway,\" said Zeb, \"or those little rascals wouldn\\'t havegobbled it up so greedily. \"\"Where are they?\" asked Dorothy, in astonishment. They all looked around, but the piglets had disappeared. \"Dear me!\" cried the Wizard; \"they must have run away. But I didn\\'t seethem go; did you?\"\"No!\" replied the boy and the girl, together. Several squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet, but theWizard could not discover a single piglet. \"Where are you?\" he asked. \"Why, right beside you,\" spoke a tiny voice. \"Can\\'t you see us?\"[Illustration: \"ARE THERE REALLY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM?\"]\"No,\" answered the little man, in a puzzled tone. \"We can see you,\" said another of the piglets. He picked it up, but could not see what heheld. \"It is very strange,\" said he, soberly. \"The piglets have becomeinvisible, in some curious way. \"\"I\\'ll bet it\\'s because they ate that peach!\" cried the kitten. \"It wasn\\'t a peach, Eureka,\" said Dorothy. \"\"It was fine, Dorothy,\" called one of the piglets. \"We\\'ll eat all we can find of them,\" said another. mus\\'n\\'t eat them,\" the Wizard warned the children, \"or we toomay become invisible, and lose each other. If we come across another ofthe strange fruit we must avoid it.\" Calling the piglets to him he picked them all up, one by one, and putthem away in his pocket; for although he could not see them he couldfeel them, and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe forthe present. It was a pretty place, with vines growing thicklyover the broad front porch. The meatwas smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange anticsand jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way. But not a singleperson appeared to be in the room. \"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy, who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood inthe doorway. A peal of merry laughter answered her, and the knives and forks fell tothe plates with a clatter. One of the chairs pushed back from the table,and this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almosttempted to run away in fright. \"Here are strangers, mama!\" cried the shrill and childish voice of someunseen person. \"So I see, my dear,\" answered another voice, soft and womanly. \"What do you want?\" demanded a third voice, in a stern, gruff accent. \"Well, well!\" said the Wizard; \"are there really people in this room? \"\"Of course,\" replied the man\\'s voice. \"And--pardon me for the foolish question--but, are you all invisible? \"\"Surely,\" the woman answered, repeating her low, rippling laughter. \"Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe? \"\"Why, yes,\" stammered the Wizard. \"All the people I have ever met beforewere very plain to see. \"\"Where do you come from, then?\" asked the woman, in a curious tone. \"We belong upon the face of the earth,\" explained the Wizard, \"butrecently, during an earthquake, we fell down a crack and landed in theCountry of the Mangaboos. \"\"Dreadful creatures!\" exclaimed the woman\\'s voice. \"I\\'ve heard of them. \"\"They walled us up in a mountain,\" continued the Wizard; \"but we foundthere was a tunnel through to this side, so we came here. It is abeautiful place. \"\"It is the Valley of Voe. \"\"Thank you. We have seen no people since we arrived, so we came to thishouse to enquire our way. \"\"Are you hungry?\" asked the woman\\'s voice. \"I could eat something,\" said Dorothy. \"So could I,\" added Zeb. \"That\\'s all right,\" returned the man\\'s voice, more pleasantly thanbefore. As he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm. Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was surethey were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if thosefolks couldn\\'t be seen. \"What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn? \"enquired the man\\'s voice. \"That\\'s Jim,\" said the girl. \"He\\'s a horse. \"\"What is he good for?\" was the next question. \"Can he fight?\" asked the man\\'s voice. he can kick pretty hard with his heels, and bite a little; but Jimcan\\'t \\'zactly fight,\" she replied. \"Then the bears will get him,\" said one of the children\\'s voices. \"Bears!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Are these bears here? \"\"That is the one evil of our country,\" answered the invisible man. \"Manylarge and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe, and when they cancatch any of us they eat us up; but as they cannot see us, we seldom getcaught. \"\"Are the bears invis\\'ble, too?\" asked the girl. \"Yes; for they eat of the dama-fruit, as we all do, and that keeps themfrom being seen by any eye, whether human or animal. \"\"Does the dama-fruit grow on a low bush, and look something like apeach?\" asked the Wizard. \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"If it makes you invis\\'ble, why do you eat it?\" Dorothy enquired. \"For two reasons, my dear,\" the woman\\'s voice answered. \"The dama-fruitis the most delicious thing that grows, and when it makes us invisiblethe bears cannot find us to eat us up. But now, good wanderers, yourluncheon is on the table, so please sit down and eat as much as youlike. \"[Illustration]CHAPTER 9. THEY FIGHT THE INVISIBLE BEARS The strangers took their seats at the table willingly enough, for theywere all hungry and the platters were now heaped with good things toeat. In front of each place was a plate bearing one of the deliciousdama-fruit, and the perfume that rose from these was so enticing andsweet that they were sorely tempted to eat of them and become invisible. But Dorothy satisfied her hunger with other things, and her companionsdid likewise, resisting the temptation. \"Why do you not eat the damas?\" asked the woman\\'s voice. \"We don\\'t want to get invis\\'ble,\" answered the girl. But if you remain visible the bears will see you and devour you,\" saida girlish young voice, that belonged to one of the children. \"We wholive here much prefer to be invisible; for we can still hug and kiss oneanother, and are quite safe from the bears. \"\"And we do not have to be so particular about our dress,\" remarked theman. \"And mama can\\'t tell whether my face is dirty or not!\" added the otherchildish voice, gleefully. \"But I make you wash it, every time I think of it,\" said the mother;\"for it stands to reason your face is dirty, Ianu, whether I can see itor not. \"Dorothy laughed and stretched out her hands. \"Come here, please--Ianu and your sister--and let me feel of you,\" sherequested. They came to her willingly, and Dorothy passed her hands over theirfaces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age and theother a boy somewhat smaller. The girl\\'s hair was soft and fluffy andher skin as smooth as satin. When Dorothy gently touched her nose andears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed. \"If I could see you I am sure you would be beautiful,\" she declared. The girl laughed, and her mother said:\"We are not vain in the Valley of Voe, because we can not display ourbeauty, and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely toour companions. \"\"How about the birds and beasts and fishes?\" asked Zeb. \"The birds we cannot see, because they love to eat of the damas as muchas we do; yet we hear their sweet songs and enjoy them. Neither can wesee the cruel bears, for they also eat the fruit. But the fishes thatswim in our brooks we can see, and often we catch them to eat. \"\"It occurs to me you have a great deal to make you happy, even whileinvisible,\" remarked the Wizard. \"Nevertheless, we prefer to remainvisible while we are in your valley. \"Just then Eureka came in, for she had been until now wandering outsidewith Jim; and when the kitten saw the table set with food she cried out:\"Now you must feed me, Dorothy, for I\\'m half starved. \"The children were inclined to be frightened by the sight of the smallanimal, which reminded them of the bears; but Dorothy reassured them byexplaining that Eureka was a pet and could do no harm even if she wishedto. Then, as the others had by this time moved away from the table, thekitten sprang upon the chair and put her paws upon the cloth to see whatthere was to eat. To her surprise an unseen hand clutched her and heldher suspended in the air. \"Did you see that, Dorothy?\" \"Yes, dear,\" her mistress replied; \"there are people living in thishouse, although we cannot see them. And you must have better manners,Eureka, or something worse will happen to you. \"She placed a plate of food upon the floor and the kitten ate greedily. \"Give me that nice-smelling fruit I saw on the table,\" she begged, whenshe had cleaned the plate. \"Those are damas,\" said Dorothy, \"and you must never even taste them,Eureka, or you\\'ll get invis\\'ble, and then we can\\'t see you at all. \"The kitten gazed wistfully at the forbidden fruit. \"Does it hurt to be invis\\'ble?\" she asked. \"I don\\'t know,\" Dorothy answered; \"but it would hurt me dre\\'fully tolose you. \"\"Very well, I won\\'t touch it,\" decided the kitten; \"but you must keep itaway from me, for the smell is very tempting. \"\"Can you tell us, sir or ma\\'am,\" said the Wizard, addressing the airbecause he did not quite know where the unseen people stood, \"if thereis any way we can get out of your beautiful Valley, and on top of theEarth again. \"\"Oh, one can leave the Valley easily enough,\" answered the man\\'s voice;\"but to do so you must enter a far less pleasant country. \"\"Oh, no,\" said Dorothy, \"we\\'ve been there, and we know. Even if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary,in order to reach the earth\\'s surface, to keep moving on toward it. \"\"In that case,\" said the man, \"it will be best for you to cross ourValley and mount the spiral staircase inside the Pyramid Mountain. Thetop of that mountain is lost in the clouds, and when you reach it youwill be in the awful Land of Naught, where the Gargoyles live. \"\"What are Gargoyles?\" asked Zeb. \"The wanderers were rather discouraged by this gloomy report, but Dorothysaid with a sigh:\"If the only way to get home is to meet the Gurgles, then we\\'ve got tomeet \\'em. They can\\'t be worse than the Wicked Witch or the Nome King. \"\"But you must remember you had the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to helpyou conquer those enemies,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Just now, my dear,there is not a single warrior in your company. \"\"Oh, I guess Zeb could fight if he had to. Couldn\\'t you, Zeb?\" asked thelittle girl. \"Perhaps; if I had to,\" answered Zeb, doubtfully. \"And you have the jointed sword that you chopped the veg\\'table Sorcererin two with,\" the girl said to the little man. \"True,\" he replied; \"and in my satchel are other useful things to fightwith. \"\"What the Gargoyles most dread is a noise,\" said the man\\'s voice. \"OurChampion told me that when he shouted his battle-cry the creaturesshuddered and drew back, hesitating to continue the combat. \"\"Very good,\" said the Wizard; \"we can all yell better than we can fight,so we ought to defeat the Gargoyles. But tell me,\" said Dorothy, \"how did such a brave Champion happen tolet the bears eat him? And if he was invis\\'ble, and the bears invis\\'ble,who knows that they really ate him up?\"\"The Champion had killed eleven bears in his time,\" returned the unseenman; \"and we know this is true because when any creature is dead theinvisible charm of the dama-fruit ceases to be active, and the slain onecan be plainly seen by all eyes. When the Champion killed a beareveryone could see it; and when the bears killed the Champion we all sawseveral pieces of him scattered about, which of course disappeared againwhen the bears devoured them. They followed the course of a broad stream and passed several morepretty cottages; but of course they saw no one, nor did any one speak tothem. About noon they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a prettyorchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plumsthat grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them:\"There are bears near by. \"The Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip. Dorothy climbed into the buggy, although Jim had been unharnessed fromit and was grazing some distance away. The owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said:\"You cannot escape the bears that way. asked Dorothy, nervously, for an unseen danger isalways the hardest to face. \"You must take to the river,\" was the reply. \"The bears will not ventureupon the water. exclaimed the girl. \"Oh, there is no need of that,\" said the voice, which from its gentletones seemed to belong to a young girl. \"You are strangers in the Valleyof Voe, and do not seem to know our ways; so I will try to save you. \"The next moment a broad-leaved plant was jerked from the ground where itgrew and held suspended in the air before the Wizard. [Illustration: ESCAPING THE INVISIBLE BEARS.]\"Sir,\" said the voice, \"you must rub these leaves upon the soles ofall your feet, and then you will be able to walk upon the water withoutsinking below the surface. It is a secret the bears do not know, and wepeople of Voe usually walk upon the water when we travel, and so escapeour enemies. \"\"Thank you!\" cried the Wizard, joyfully, and at once rubbed a leaf uponthe soles of Dorothy\\'s shoes and then upon his own. The girl took a leafand rubbed it upon the kitten\\'s paws, and the rest of the plant washanded to Zeb, who, after applying it to his own feet, carefully rubbedit upon all four of Jim\\'s hoofs and then upon the tires of thebuggy-wheels. He had nearly finished this last task when a low growlingwas suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciouslywith his heels. \"Quick! To the water, or you are lost!\" cried their unseen friend, andwithout hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out uponthe broad river, for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in herarms. The horse was plunging madly about, and two or three deep gashesappeared upon its flanks, from which the blood flowed freely. Assoon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himselfsafe from pursuit, and Zeb was already running across the water towardDorothy. Thethird time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and afall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear,which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer. Dorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current ofthe water, and the others made haste to join her. The Wizard opened hissatchel and got out some sticking-plaster with which he mended the cutsJim had received from the claws of the bears. \"I think we\\'d better stick to the river, after this,\" said Dorothy. \"\"That is true,\" agreed the Wizard, \"and as the river seems to be flowingin the direction of the Pyramid Mountain it will be the easiest way forus to travel. \"Zeb hitched Jim to the buggy again, and the horse trotted along and drewthem rapidly over the smooth water. The kitten was at first dreadfullyafraid of getting wet, but Dorothy let her down and soon Eureka wasfrisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit. Once alittle fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed it in hermouth and ate it up as quick as a wink; but Dorothy cautioned her to becareful what she ate in this valley of enchantments, and no more fisheswere careless enough to swim within reach. After a journey of several hours they came to a point where the rivercurved, and they found they must cross a mile or so of the Valley beforethey came to the Pyramid Mountain. There were few houses in this part,and few orchards or flowers; so our friends feared they might encountermore of the savage bears, which they had learned to dread with all theirhearts. \"You\\'ll have to make a dash, Jim,\" said the Wizard, \"and run as fast asyou can go. \"\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"I\\'ll do my best. But you must rememberI\\'m old, and my dashing days are past and gone. \"All three got into the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jimneeded no guidance of any sort. The horse was still smarting from thesharp claws of the invisible bears, and as soon as he was on land andheaded toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsomecreatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along ina way that made Dorothy catch her breath. Then Zeb, in a spirit of mischief, uttered a growl like that of thebears, and Jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew. \"I--I\\'m \\'fraid he\\'s--he\\'s running away!\" gasped Dorothy. \"I _know_ he is,\" said Zeb; \"but no bear can catch him if he keeps upthat gait--and the harness or the buggy don\\'t break. Dorothy nearly went with them, but she was holding fast to the iron railof the seat, and that saved her. She squeezed the kitten, though, untilit screeched; and then the old cab-horse made several curious soundsthat led the little girl to suspect he was laughing at them all. [Illustration]CHAPTER 10. THE BRAIDED MAN OF PYRAMID MOUNTAINThe mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that itspoint was lost in the clouds.   These steps lead to the        Land of the Gargoyles. \"I wonder how Jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs,\"said Dorothy, gravely. \"No trouble at all,\" declared the horse, with a contemptuous neigh. \"Still, I don\\'t care to drag any passengers. You\\'ll all have to walk. \"\"Suppose the stairs get steeper?\" suggested Zeb, doubtfully. \"Then you\\'ll have to boost the buggy-wheels, that\\'s all,\" answered Jim. \"We\\'ll try it, anyway,\" said the Wizard. \"It\\'s the only way to get outof the Valley of Voe. \"So they began to ascend the stairs, Dorothy and the Wizard first, Jimnext, drawing the buggy, and then Zeb to watch that nothing happened tothe harness. The light was dim, and soon they mounted into total darkness, so thatthe Wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way. Butthis enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing wherethere was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light andair. Looking through this opening they could see the Valley of Voe lyingfar below them, the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance. After resting a few moments they resumed their climb, and still thestairs were broad and low enough for Jim to draw the buggy easily afterhim. The old horse panted a little, and had to stop often to get hisbreath. At such times they were all glad to wait for him, forcontinually climbing up stairs is sure to make one\\'s legs ache. They wound about, always going upward, for some time. The lights fromthe lanterns dimly showed the way, but it was a gloomy journey, and theywere pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they werecoming to a second landing. Here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it, like the mouth ofa cavern, and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor andcommenced ascending again at the opposite edge. The opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the Valley ofVoe, and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene. Theblues and greys were very beautiful, and Dorothy noticed that on thecloud banks sat or reclined fleecy, shadowy forms of beautiful beingswho must have been the Cloud Fairies. \"Are they real?\" asked Zeb, in an awed voice. \"Of course,\" replied Dorothy, softly. \"\"They seem like open-work,\" remarked the boy, gazing intently. \"If Ishould squeeze one, there wouldn\\'t be anything left of it. suddenly exclaimed the little Wizard. He was a very old man, bent nearly double; but the queerestthing about him was his white hair and beard. \"Where did you come from?\" asked Dorothy, wonderingly. \"No place at all,\" answered the man with the braids; \"that is, notrecently. Once I lived on top the earth, but for many years I have hadmy factory in this spot--half way up Pyramid Mountain. \"\"Are we only half way up?\" enquired the boy, in a discouraged tone. \"I believe so, my lad,\" replied the braided man. as I have neverbeen in either direction, down or up, since I arrived, I cannot bepositive whether it is exactly half way or not. \"\"Have you a factory in this place?\" asked the Wizard, who had beenexamining the strange personage carefully. \"To be sure,\" said the other. \"\"I thought so,\" said the Wizard, with a sigh. \"[Illustration: THE CLOUD FAIRIES.][Illustration: THE BRAIDED MAN.]\"Yes, indeed; come into my shop, please,\" and the braided man turned andled the way into a smaller cave, where he evidently lived. \"This,\" said the man, taking up a box and handling it gently, \"containstwelve dozen rustles--enough to last any lady a year. Will you buy it,my dear?\" he asked, addressing Dorothy. \"My gown isn\\'t silk,\" she said, smiling. \"Never mind. When you open the box the rustles will escape, whether youare wearing a silk dress or not,\" said the man, seriously. Then hepicked up another box. \"In this,\" he continued, \"are many assortedflutters. Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will never bewithout them. \"\"I have no money with me,\" said the Wizard, evasively. \"I do not want money,\" returned the braided man, \"for I could not spendit in this deserted place if I had it. But I would like very much a bluehair-ribbon. \"\"I\\'ll get you one!\" cried Dorothy, who was sorry for the poor man; soshe ran back to the buggy and took from her suit-case a pretty blueribbon. It did her good to see how the braided man\\'s eyes sparkled whenhe received this treasure. \"You have made me very, very happy, my dear!\" he exclaimed; and then heinsisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girlaccepting the box of rustles. \"You may need them, some time,\" he said, \"and there is really no use inmy manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them. \"\"Why did you leave the surface of the earth?\" enquired the Wizard. \"I could not help it. Here, then, I made my home; andalthough it is a lonely place I amuse myself making rustles andflutters, and so get along very nicely. \"When the braided man had completed this strange tale Dorothy nearlylaughed, because it was all so absurd; but the Wizard tapped hisforehead significantly, to indicate that he thought the poor man wascrazy. [Illustration]CHAPTER 11. THEY MEET THE WOODEN GARGOYLESAnother breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landingwhere there was a rift in the mountain. But the travellers were obliged to rest, and while they were sitting onthe rocky floor the Wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the ninetiny piglets. To his delight they were now plainly visible, which provedthat they had passed beyond the influence of the magical Valley of Voe. \"Why, we can see each other again!\" cried one, joyfully. \"Yes,\" sighed Eureka; \"and I also can see you again, and the sightmakes me dreadfully hungry. Please, Mr. Wizard, may I eat just one ofthe fat little piglets? You\\'d never miss _one_ of them, I\\'m sure! \"\"What a horrid, savage beast!\" exclaimed a piglet; \"and after we\\'ve beensuch good friends, too, and played with one another! \"\"When I\\'m not hungry, I love to play with you all,\" said the kitten,demurely; \"but when my stomach is empty it seems that nothing would fillit so nicely as a fat piglet. \"\"And we trusted you so!\" said another of the nine, reproachfully. And thought you were respectable!\" said another. \"It seems we were mistaken,\" declared a third, looking at the kittentimorously, \"no one with such murderous desires should belong to ourparty, I\\'m sure. \"\"You see, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy, reprovingly, \"you are makingyourself disliked. There are certain things proper for a kitten to eat; but I never heard of a kitten eating a pig, under _any_ cir\\'stances. \"\"Did you ever see such little pigs before?\" asked the kitten. \"They areno bigger than mice, and I\\'m sure mice are proper for me to eat. \"\"It isn\\'t the bigness, dear; its the variety,\" replied the girl. \"Theseare Mr. Wizard\\'s pets, just as you are my pet, and it wouldn\\'t be anymore proper for you to eat them than it would be for Jim to eat you. And that\\'s just what I shall do if you don\\'t let those little balls ofpork alone,\" said Jim, glaring at the kitten with his round, big eyes. \"If you injure any one of them I\\'ll chew you up instantly. \"The kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully, as if trying to decidewhether he meant it or not. \"In that case,\" she said, \"I\\'ll leave them alone. You haven\\'t many teethleft, Jim, but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder. \"\"That is right, Eureka,\" remarked the Wizard, earnestly. \"Let us all bea happy family and love one another. \"I\\'ve always loved the piglets,\" she said; \"but they don\\'t love me. \"\"No one can love a person he\\'s afraid of,\" asserted Dorothy. \"If youbehave, and don\\'t scare the little pigs, I\\'m sure they\\'ll grow very fondof you. \"The Wizard now put the nine tiny ones back into his pocket and thejourney was resumed. \"We must be pretty near the top, now,\" said the boy, as they climbedwearily up the dark, winding stairway. \"The Country of the Gurgles can\\'t be far from the top of the earth,\"remarked Dorothy. \"It isn\\'t very nice down here. I\\'d like to get homeagain, I\\'m sure. \"No one replied to this, because they found they needed all their breathfor the climb. The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizardoften had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another, or keepit from jamming against the rocky walls. \"Thank goodness we\\'re nearly there!\" panted the little Wizard. Jim, who was in advance, saw the last stair before him and stuck hishead above the rocky sides of the stairway. \"Let\\'s go down again!\" he said, in his hoarse voice. \"What\\'s the matter with you, oldman? \"\"Everything,\" grumbled the horse. Everything\\'s dead, upthere--no flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere. \"\"Never mind; we can\\'t turn back,\" said Dorothy; \"and we don\\'t intend tostay there, anyhow. \"See here, my good steed,\" broke in the Wizard, \"little Dorothy and Ihave been in many queer countries in our travels, and always escapedwithout harm. We\\'ve even been to the marvelous Land of Oz--haven\\'t we,Dorothy?--so we don\\'t much care what the Country of the Gargoyles islike. Go ahead, Jim, and whatever happens we\\'ll make the best of it. \"\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"this is your excursion, and not mine;so if you get into trouble don\\'t blame me. \"The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden!\" exclaimed Zeb; and so itwas. There were odd woodenhouses, with carved wooden flowers in the front yards. Thepatches of grass were splinters of wood, and where neither grass norsawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring. Wooden birds flutteredamong the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass; butthe most amazing things of all were the wooden people--the creaturesknown as Gargoyles. Their bodies were round, their legs short and thick and theirarms extraordinarily long and stout. Their heads were too big for theirbodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon. Some had long,curved noses and chins, small eyes and wide, grinning mouths. Others hadflat noses, protruding eyes, and ears that were shaped like those of anelephant. The tops of their heads hadno hair, but were carved into a variety of fantastic shapes, some havinga row of points or balls around the top, other designs resemblingflowers or vegetables, and still others having squares that looked likewaffles cut criss-cross on their heads. They all wore short wooden wingswhich were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hingeswith wooden screws, and with these wings they flew swiftly andnoiselessly here and there, their legs being of little use to them. They made no sounds at all, either in flying or trying tospeak, and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made withtheir wooden fingers or lips. Neither was there any sound to be heardanywhere throughout the wooden country. The birds did not sing, nor didthe cows moo; yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere. Inturn the Wizard and the children, the horse and the kitten, examined theGargoyles with the same silent attention. \"There\\'s going to be trouble, I\\'m sure,\" remarked the horse. \"Unhitchthose tugs, Zeb, and set me free from the buggy, so I can fightcomfortably. \"\"Jim\\'s right,\" sighed the Wizard. \"There\\'s going to be trouble, and mysword isn\\'t stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies--so I shall haveto get out my revolvers. \"What harm can the Gurgles do?\" asked Dorothy. \"They have no weapons tohurt us with. \"\"Each of their arms is a wooden club,\" answered the little man, \"and I\\'msure the creatures mean mischief, by the looks of their eyes. Even theserevolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies,and after that we will be at their mercy. \"\"But why fight at all, in that case?\" asked the girl. \"So I may die with a clear conscience,\" returned the Wizard, gravely. \"It\\'s every man\\'s duty to do the best he knows how; and I\\'m going to doit. \"\"Wish I had an axe,\" said Zeb, who by now had unhitched the horse. The horse hadespecially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest andstrangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of theirfirst attack. Crack! crash! went his iron-shod hoofs against the wooden bodies of theGargoyles, and they were battered right and left with such force thatthey scattered like straws in the wind. The others picked themselves up fromthe ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows, so for amoment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease. \"Those wooden things are impossible to hurt,\" he said, \"and all thedamage Jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their nosesand ears. That cannot make them look any uglier, I\\'m sure, and it is myopinion they will soon renew the attack. \"\"What made them fly away?\" asked Dorothy. \"The noise, of course. Don\\'t you remember how the Champion escaped themby shouting his battle-cry?\"\"Suppose we escape down the stairs, too,\" suggested the boy. \"We havetime, just now, and I\\'d rather face the invis\\'ble bears than thosewooden imps. \"\"No,\" returned Dorothy, stoutly, \"it won\\'t do to go back, for then wewould never get home. Let\\'s fight it out. \"\"That is what I advise,\" said the Wizard. \"They haven\\'t defeated us yet,and Jim is worth a whole army. \"But the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the nexttime. The Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of hisenemies, and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silentplace. Some of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground, where they quiveredand trembled in every limb; but most of them managed to wheel and escapeagain to a distance. Zeb ran and picked up one of the Gargoyles that lay nearest to him. Thetop of its head was carved into a crown and the Wizard\\'s bullet hadstruck it exactly in the left eye, which was a hard wooden knot. Before this crowned Gargoyle had recoveredhimself Zeb had wound a strap several times around its body, confiningits wings and arms so that it could not move. Then, having tied thewooden creature securely, the boy buckled the strap and tossed hisprisoner into the buggy. By that time the others had all retired. [Illustration]CHAPTER 12. A WONDERFUL ESCAPEFor a while the enemy hesitated to renew the attack. \"That\\'s fine ,\" said Zeb. \"We\\'ve got \\'em on the run now, sure enough. \"\"But only for a time,\" replied the Wizard, shaking his head gloomily. \"These revolvers are good for six shots each, but when those are gone weshall be helpless. \"The Gargoyles seemed to realize this, for they sent a few of their bandtime after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from thelittle man\\'s revolvers. [Illustration: THE WIZARD FIRED INTO THE THRONG.]\"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously. \"Let\\'s yell--all together,\" said Zeb. \"And fight at the same time,\" added the Wizard. \"We will get near Jim,so that he can help us, and each one must take some weapon and do thebest he can. I\\'ll use my sword, although it isn\\'t much account in thisaffair. Dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when thewooden folks attack her. I haven\\'t anything for you, Zeb. \"\"I\\'ll use the king,\" said the boy, and pulled his prisoner out of thebuggy. The boywas strong for one of his years, having always worked upon a farm; so hewas likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard. Even the kitten gave a dreadfullyshrill scream and at the same time Jim the cab-horse neighed loudly. Perceiving this, as well as the fact that there were no more ofthe awful \"bangs\" to come from the revolvers, the Gargoyles advanced ina swarm as thick as bees, so that the air was filled with them. Dorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol, which nearlycovered her and proved a great protection. The Wizard\\'s sword-bladesnapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against thewooden people. The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even Eurekaassisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched and bitat them like a wild-cat. The wooden things woundtheir long arms around Zeb and the Wizard and held them fast. Dorothywas captured in the same way, and numbers of the Gargoyles clung toJim\\'s legs, so weighting him down that the poor beast was helpless. All of them expected nothing less than instant death; but to theirsurprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore themfar away, over miles and miles of wooden country, until they came to awooden city. They were tower-like in shape and the best ofthem seemed old and weather-worn; yet all were strong and substantial. The Gargoyles roughly pushed them into the opening, wherethere was a platform, and then flew away and left them. As they had nowings the strangers could not fly away, and if they jumped down fromsuch a height they would surely be killed. The creatures had senseenough to reason that way, and the only mistake they made was insupposing the earth people were unable to overcome such ordinarydifficulties. Jim was brought with the others, although it took a good many Gargoylesto carry the big beast through the air and land him on the highplatform, and the buggy was thrust in after him because it belonged tothe party and the wooden folks had no idea what it was used for orwhether it was alive or not. When Eureka\\'s captor had thrown the kittenafter the others the last Gargoyle silently disappeared, leaving ourfriends to breathe freely once more. \"What an awful fight!\" said Dorothy, catching her breath in littlegasps. \"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" purred Eureka, smoothing her ruffled fur with herpaw; \"we didn\\'t manage to hurt anybody, and nobody managed to hurt us. \"\"Thank goodness we are together again, even if we are prisoners,\" sighedthe little girl. \"I wonder why they didn\\'t kill us on the spot,\" remarked Zeb, who hadlost his king in the struggle. \"They are probably keeping us for some ceremony,\" the Wizard answered,reflectively; \"but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead aspossible in a short time. \"\"As dead as poss\\'ble would be pretty dead, wouldn\\'t it?\" asked Dorothy. \"Yes, my dear. But we have no need to worry about that just now. Let usexamine our prison and see what it is like. From their platform a stair descended into the house, and the childrenand the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them theway. Had therebeen any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards ofthe house been so thick and stout, escape would have been easy; but toremain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship, andthey did not like the darkness or the damp smell. Looking out, they could see into some of thehouses near them, where there were open windows in abundance, and wereable to mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in theirdwellings. \"This seems to be their time of rest,\" observed the Wizard. \"\"I feel sleepy myself,\" remarked Zeb, yawning. \"Why, where\\'s Eureka?\" cried Dorothy, suddenly. They all looked around, but the kitten was no place to be seen. \"She\\'s gone out for a walk,\" said Jim, gruffly. On the roof?\" asked the girl. \"\"She couldn\\'t climb _down_, Jim,\" said Dorothy. \"To climb means to goup. \"\"Who said so?\" demanded the horse. \"My school-teacher said so; and she knows a lot, Jim. \"\"To \\'climb down\\' is sometimes used as a figure of speech,\" remarked theWizard. \"Well, this was a figure of a cat,\" said Jim, \"and she _went_ down,anyhow, whether she climbed or crept. \"\"Dear me! how careless Eureka is,\" exclaimed the girl, much distressed. \"The Gurgles will get her, sure! \"\"Ha, ha!\" chuckled the old cab-horse; \"they\\'re not \\'Gurgles,\\' littlemaid; they\\'re Gargoyles. \"\"Never mind; they\\'ll get Eureka, whatever they\\'re called. \"\"No they won\\'t,\" said the voice of the kitten, and Eureka herselfcrawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon thefloor. asked Dorothy, sternly. \"Watching the wooden folks. They\\'re too funny for anything, Dorothy. Just now they are all going to bed, and--what do you think?--they unhookthe hinges of their wings and put them in a corner until they wake upagain. \"\"No; the wings. \"\"That,\" said Zeb, \"explains why this house is used by them for a prison. If any of the Gargoyles act badly, and have to be put in jail, they arebrought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them untilthey promise to be good. \"The Wizard had listened intently to what Eureka had said. \"I wish we had some of those loose wings,\" he said. \"Could we fly with them?\" asked Dorothy. \"I think so. If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to flylies in the wings themselves, and not in the wooden bodies of the peoplewho wear them. So, if we had the wings, we could probably fly as well asthey do--at least while we are in their country and under the spell ofits magic. \"\"But how would it help us to be able to fly?\" questioned the girl. \"Come here,\" said the little man, and took her to one of the corners ofthe building. \"Yes; it\\'s a good way off, but I can see it,\" she replied. I\\'ll get my spy-glass, and then you can see itmore plainly. \"He fetched a small but powerful telescope, which had been in hissatchel, and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening. \"Where does it lead to?\" she asked. \"That I cannot tell,\" said the Wizard; \"but we cannot now be far belowthe earth\\'s surface, and that entrance may lead to another stairway thatwill bring us on top of our world again, where we belong. So, if we hadthe wings, and could escape the Gargoyles, we might fly to that rock andbe saved. \"\"I\\'ll get you the wings,\" said Zeb, who had thoughtfully listened to allthis. \"That is, if the kitten will show me where they are. \"\"But how can you get down?\" enquired the girl, wonderingly. [Illustration: THE FIGHT WITH THE GARGOYLES.]\"I can climb down that, all right,\" he said. \"No you can\\'t,\" remarked Jim, with a twinkle in his round eyes. \"You may_go_ down, but you can only _climb_ up.\"\"Well, I\\'ll climb up when I get back, then,\" said the boy, with a laugh. \"Now, Eureka, you\\'ll have to show me the way to those wings. \"\"You must be very quiet,\" warned the kitten; \"for if you make the leastnoise the Gargoyles will wake up. \"\"I\\'m not going to drop a pin,\" said Zeb. He had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy, and now helet the line dangle over the side of the house. \"Be careful,\" cautioned Dorothy, earnestly. \"I will,\" said the boy, and let himself slide over the edge. The girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his waycarefully downward, hand over hand, until he stood upon the groundbelow. Eureka clung with her claws to the wooden side of the house andlet herself down easily. Then together they crept away to enter the lowdoorway of a neighboring dwelling. The watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again appeared,his arms now full of the wooden wings. When he came to where the strap was hanging he tied the wings all in abunch to the end of the line, and the Wizard drew them up. Then the linewas let down again for Zeb to climb up by. Eureka quickly followed him,and soon they were all standing together upon the platform, with eightof the much prized wooden wings beside them. The boy was no longer sleepy, but full of energy and excitement. Then, with theWizard\\'s help, he tried to fasten some of the wings to the oldcab-horse. This was no easy task, because half of each one of the hinges of thewings was missing, it being still fastened to the body of the Gargoylewho had used it. The other four wings were then fastened to the buggy, two on each side,for the buggy must bear the weight of the children and the Wizard as itflew through the air. [Illustration: JIM FLUTTERED AND FLOUNDERED THROUGH THE AIR.] These preparations had not consumed a great deal of time, but thesleeping Gargoyles were beginning to wake up and move around, and soonsome of them would be hunting for their missing wings. They mounted into the buggy, Dorothy holding Eureka safe in her lap. Thegirl sat in the middle of the seat, with Zeb and the Wizard on each sideof her. When all was ready the boy shook the reins and said:\"Fly away, Jim!\"\"Which wings must I flop first?\" asked the cab-horse, undecidedly. \"Flop them all together,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Some of them are crooked,\" objected the horse. \"Never mind; we will steer with the wings on the buggy,\" said Zeb. \"Justyou light out and make for that rock, Jim; and don\\'t waste any timeabout it, either.\"So the horse gave a groan, flopped its four wings all together, and flewaway from the platform. Dorothy was a little anxious about the successof their trip, for the way Jim arched his long neck and spread out hisbony legs as he fluttered and floundered through the air was enough tomake anybody nervous. He groaned, too, as if frightened, and the wingscreaked dreadfully because the Wizard had forgotten to oil them; butthey kept fairly good time with the wings of the buggy, so that theymade excellent progress from the start. Some of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, and lost no time incollecting a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when Dorothyhappened to look back she saw them coming in a great cloud that almostdarkened the sky. [Illustration]CHAPTER 13. THE DEN OF THE DRAGONETTESOur friends had a good start and were able to maintain it, for withtheir eight wings they could go just as fast as could the Gargoyles. Allthe way to the great rock the wooden people followed them, and when Jimfinally alighted at the mouth of the cavern the pursuers were still somedistance away. \"But, I\\'m afraid they\\'ll catch us yet,\" said Dorothy, greatly excited. \"No; we must stop them,\" declared the Wizard. \"Quick Zeb, help me pulloff these wooden wings!\" They tore off the wings, for which they had no further use, and theWizard piled them in a heap just outside the entrance to the cavern. The flames leaped up at once and the bonfire began to smoke and roar andcrackle just as the great army of wooden Gargoyles arrived. Thecreatures drew back at once, being filled with fear and horror; for sucha dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all thehistory of their wooden land. Inside the archway were several doors, leading to different rooms builtinto the mountain, and Zeb and the Wizard lifted these wooden doors fromtheir hinges and tossed them all on the flames. \"That will prove a barrier for some time to come,\" said the little man,smiling pleasantly all over his wrinkled face at the success of theirstratagem. \"Perhaps the flames will set fire to all that miserablewooden country, and if it does the loss will be very small and theGargoyles never will be missed. Asort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way, and they found the floorof it both rough and steep. This delayed and bothered themfor a while, because they did not wish to leave the buggy behind them. In this position theymanaged, with the aid of the patient cab-horse, to drag the vehiclethrough the narrow part of the passage. \"Anyhow,\" said Dorothy, \"we\\'ve \\'scaped those awful Gurgles, and that\\'s_one_ comfort! \"[Illustration: \"WHY IT\\'S A DRAGON!\"]\"Probably the Gargoyles are still busy trying to put out the fire,\"returned the Wizard. \"But even if they succeeded in doing that itwould be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks; so I amsure we need fear them no longer. Sometimes they had to climb over heaps of looserock, where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy. At such times Dorothy,Zeb and the Wizard all pushed behind, and lifted the wheels over theroughest places; so they managed, by dint of hard work, to keep going. \"What sort of a place is this?\" asked the boy, trying to see moreclearly through the gloom. \"I cannot imagine, I\\'m sure,\" answered the Wizard, also peering about. Don\\'t you see their terrible eyes? \"\"Eureka sees better in the dark than we can,\" whispered Dorothy. \"Tellus, dear, what do the creatures look like?\" she asked, addressing herpet. \"I simply can\\'t describe \\'em,\" answered the kitten, shuddering. \"Theireyes are like pie-plates and their mouths like coal-scuttles. But theirbodies don\\'t seem very big. \"\"Where are they?\" enquired the girl. \"They are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern. Oh,Dorothy--you can\\'t imagine what horrid things they are! \"\"Tut-tut! be careful how you criticise your neighbors,\" spoke a raspingvoice near by. \"As a matter of fact you are rather ugly-lookingcreatures yourselves, and I\\'m sure mother has often told us we were theloveliest and prettiest things in all the world. he exclaimed. \"No,\" answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking atthem so steadily; \"you are wrong about that. We hope to grow to bedragons some day, but just now we\\'re only dragonettes. \"\"What\\'s that?\" asked Dorothy, gazing fearfully at the great scaley head,the yawning mouth and the big eyes. \"Young dragons, of course; but we are not allowed to call ourselves realdragons until we get our full growth,\" was the reply. \"The big dragonsare very proud, and don\\'t think children amount to much; but mother saysthat some day we will all be very powerful and important. \"\"Where is your mother?\" asked the Wizard, anxiously looking around. If shehas good luck she will bring us an elephant, or a brace of rhinoceri, orperhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger. \"\"Oh; are you hungry?\" enquired Dorothy, drawing back. \"Very,\" said the dragonette, snapping its jaws. \"And--and--do you eat people? \"\"To be sure, when we can get them. But they\\'ve been very scarce for afew years and we usually have to be content with elephants orbuffaloes,\" answered the creature, in a regretful tone. \"How old are you?\" enquired Zeb, who stared at the yellow eyes as iffascinated. \"Quite young, I grieve to say; and all of my brothers and sisters thatyou see here are practically my own age. If I remember rightly, we weresixty-six years old the day before yesterday. \"\"But that isn\\'t young!\" cried Dorothy, in amazement. \"\"How old is your mother?\" asked the girl. She\\'s a littlefussy, you know, and afraid of growing old, being a widow and still inher prime. \"\"I should think she would be,\" agreed Dorothy. Then, after a moment\\'sthought, she asked: \"Are we friends or enemies? I mean, will you be goodto us, or do you intend to eat us? \"\"As for that, we dragonettes would love to eat you, my child; butunfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the backof our individual caves, so that we can not crawl out to get you. If youchoose to come nearer we will make a mouthful of you in a wink; butunless you do you will remain quite safe. \"There was a regretful accent in the creature\\'s voice, and at the wordsall the other dragonettes sighed dismally. Dorothy felt relieved. Presently she asked:\"Why did your mother tie your tails?\"\"Oh, she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips, andif we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight witheach other and get into a lot of mischief. Mother usually knows what sheis about, but she made a mistake this time; for you are sure to escapeus unless you come too near, and you probably won\\'t do that. \"\"No, indeed!\" said the little girl. \"We don\\'t wish to be eaten by suchawful beasts. \"\"Permit me to say,\" returned the dragonette, \"that you are ratherimpolite to call us names, knowing that we cannot resent your insults. And we are of an excellent family and have apedigree that I challenge any humans to equal, as it extends back abouttwenty thousand years, to the time of the famous Green Dragon ofAtlantis, who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created. Canyou match that pedigree, little girl?\"\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I was born on a farm in Kansas, and I guessthat\\'s being just as \\'spectable and haughty as living in a cave withyour tail tied to a rock. If it isn\\'t I\\'ll have to stand it, that\\'sall. \"\"Tastes differ,\" murmured the dragonette, slowly drooping its scaleyeyelids over its yellow eyes, until they looked like half-moons. Their front legs, which grew just back of theirheads, were also strong and big; but their bodies were smaller aroundthan their heads, and dwindled away in a long line until their tailswere slim as a shoe-string. Dorothy thought, if it had taken themsixty-six years to grow to this size, that it would be fully a hundredyears more before they could hope to call themselves dragons, and thatseemed like a good while to wait to grow up. \"It occurs to me,\" said the Wizard, \"that we ought to get out of thisplace before the mother dragon comes back. \"\"Don\\'t hurry,\" called one of the dragonettes; \"mother will be glad tomeet you, I\\'m sure. \"\"You may be right,\" replied the Wizard, \"but we\\'re a little particularabout associating with strangers. Will you kindly tell us which way yourmother went to get on top the earth? \"\"That is not a fair question to ask us,\" declared another dragonette. \"\"Then,\" decided Dorothy, \"we must find our way out the best we can. [Illustration]Chapter 14. OZMA USES THE MAGIC BELTFor a considerable distance the way led straight upward in a gentleincline, and the wanderers made such good progress that they grewhopeful and eager, thinking they might see sunshine at any minute. Jim the cab-horse came last, and the rocky wall almost caught him; forjust as he leaped to the floor of the further passage the wall swungacross it and a loose stone that the buggy wheels knocked against fellinto the narrow crack where the rock turned, and became wedged there. \"Never mind,\" said Zeb, \"we don\\'t want to get back, anyhow. \"\"I\\'m not so sure of that,\" returned Dorothy. \"The mother dragon may comedown and catch us here. \"\"Then we\\'re all right,\" said the girl, \"for if the dragon went the otherway she can\\'t poss\\'bly get to us now. \"\"Of course not, my dear. But there is another thing to consider. Themother dragon probably knows the road to the earth\\'s surface, and if shewent the other way then we have come the wrong way,\" said the Wizard,thoughtfully. \"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy. \"That would be unlucky, wouldn\\'t it?\"\"Very. Unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth,\" saidZeb. \"For my part, if we manage to get out of here I\\'ll be glad it isn\\'tthe way the dragon goes. \"\"So will I,\" returned Dorothy. Thelanterns were beginning to grow dim, and the Wizard poured the remainingoil from one into the other, so that the one light would last longer. They did not realize their ill fortune at first, for their hearts weregladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crackin the roof of the cave, far overhead. That meant that their world--thereal world--was not very far away, and that the succession of perilousadventures they had encountered had at last brought them near theearth\\'s surface, which meant home to them. \"But we\\'re _almost_ on earth again,\" cried Dorothy, \"for there is thesun--the most _beau\\'ful_ sun that shines!\" and she pointed eagerly atthe crack in the distant roof. \"Almost on earth isn\\'t being there,\" said the kitten, in a discontentedtone. \"It wouldn\\'t be possible for even me to get up to that crack--orthrough it if I got there. \"\"It appears that the path ends here,\" announced the Wizard, gloomily. \"And there is no way to go back,\" added Zeb, with a low whistle ofperplexity. \"I was sure it would come to this, in the end,\" remarked the oldcab-horse. And the wholething has been unnatural because that cat and I are both able to talkyour language, and to understand the words you say. \"\"And so can the nine tiny piglets,\" added Eureka. \"Don\\'t forget them,for I may have to eat them, after all. \"\"I\\'ve heard animals talk before,\" said Dorothy, \"and no harm came ofit. \"\"Were you ever before shut up in a cave, far under the earth, with noway of getting out?\" enquired the horse, seriously. \"No,\" answered Dorothy. \"But don\\'t you lose heart, Jim, for I\\'m surethis isn\\'t the end of our story, by any means. \"My dears,\" he said to them, \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ve got you into a lot oftrouble, and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomycave. \"\"What\\'s wrong?\" asked a piglet. \"We\\'ve been in the dark quite a while,and you may as well explain what has happened. \"Well,\" said another piglet, \"you are a wizard, are you not? \"\"I am,\" replied the little man. \"Then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole,\" declared thetiny one, with much confidence. \"I could if I happened to be a real wizard,\" returned the master sadly. \"\"Nonsense!\" cried several of the piglets, together. \"You can ask Dorothy,\" said the little man, in an injured tone. \"It\\'s true enough,\" returned the girl, earnestly. \"Our friend Oz ismerely a humbug wizard, for he once proved it to me. He can do severalvery wonderful things--if he knows how. But he can\\'t wiz a single thingif he hasn\\'t the tools and machinery to work with. \"\"Thank you, my dear, for doing me justice,\" responded the Wizard,gratefully. \"To be accused of being a real wizard, when I\\'m not, is aslander I will not tamely submit to. \"\"I don\\'t believe we\\'ll realize anything, when it comes to that,\"remarked Dorothy, who had been deep in thought. \"But I\\'m not going toscatter my bones just yet, because I need them, and you prob\\'ly needyours, too. \"\"We are helpless to escape,\" sighed the Wizard. \"_We_ may be helpless,\" answered Dorothy, smiling at him, \"but there areothers who can do more than we can. Cheer up, friends. I\\'m sure Ozmawill help us. exclaimed the Wizard. \"\"The girl that rules the marvelous Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"\"For the second time?\" asked the Wizard, with great interest. \"Yes. \"\"I remember those shoes,\" said the little man, nodding. \"They oncebelonged to the Wicked Witch. \"But thesecond time I went to the Land of Oz I owned the Nome King\\'s Magic Belt,which is much more powerful than were the Silver Shoes. \"\"Where is that Magic Belt?\" enquired the Wizard, who had listened withgreat interest. \"Ozma has it; for its powers won\\'t work in a common, ordinary countrylike the United States. Anyone in a fairy country like the Land of Ozcan do anything with it; so I left it with my friend the Princess Ozma,who used it to wish me in Australia with Uncle Henry. asked Zeb, astonished at what he heard. \"Of course; in just a jiffy. And Ozma has an enchanted picture hangingin her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends maybe, at any time she chooses. All she has to do is to say: \\'I wonder whatSo-and-so is doing,\\' and at once the picture shows where her friend isand what the friend is doing. That\\'s _real_ magic, Mr. Wizard; isn\\'t it? Well, every day at four o\\'clock Ozma has promised to look at me in thatpicture, and if I am in need of help I am to make her a certain sign andshe will put on the Nome King\\'s Magic Belt and wish me to be with her inOz.\"\"Do you mean that Princess Ozma will see this cave in her enchantedpicture, and see all of us here, and what we are doing?\" demanded Zeb. \"Of course; when it is four o\\'clock,\" she replied, with a laugh at hisstartled expression. \"And when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the Land of Oz?\"continued the boy. \"That\\'s it, exactly; by means of the Magic Belt. \"\"Then,\" said the Wizard, \"you will be saved, little Dorothy; and I amvery glad of it. The rest of us will die much more cheerfully when weknow you have escaped our sad fate. \"\"_I_ won\\'t die cheerfully!\" protested the kitten. \"There\\'s nothingcheerful about dying that I could ever see, although they say a cat hasnine lives, and so must die nine times. \"\"Have you ever died yet?\" enquired the boy. \"No, and I\\'m not anxious to begin ,\" said Eureka. \"Don\\'t worry, dear,\" Dorothy exclaimed, \"I\\'ll hold you in my arms, andtake you with me. cried the nine tiny piglets, all in one breath. \"Perhaps I can,\" answered Dorothy. \"I\\'ll try. \"\"Couldn\\'t you manage to hold me in your arms?\" asked the cab-horse. Dorothy laughed. \"I\\'ll do better than that,\" she promised, \"for I can easily save youall, once I am myself in the Land of Oz.\"\"How?\" they asked. \"By using the Magic Belt. All I need do is to wish you with me, andthere you\\'ll be--safe in the royal palace! \"\"Good!\" cried Zeb. \"I built that palace, and the Emerald City, too,\" remarked the Wizard,in a thoughtful tone, \"and I\\'d like to see them again, for I was veryhappy among the Munchkins and Winkies and Quadlings and Gillikins. \"\"Who are they?\" asked the boy. \"The four nations that inhabit the Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"\"Of course they would!\" declared Dorothy. \"\"Do you happen to know whatever became of the Tin Woodman and theScarecrow?\" he enquired. \"They live in Oz yet,\" said the girl, \"and are very important people. \"\"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t know the Hungry Tiger and Billina,\" said the Wizard,shaking his head. \"Is Billina a girl? \"\"No; she\\'s a yellow hen, and a great friend of mine. You\\'re sure to likeBillina, when you know her,\" asserted Dorothy. \"Your friends sound like a menagerie,\" remarked Zeb, uneasily. \"Couldn\\'t you wish me in some safer place than Oz.\"\"Don\\'t worry,\" replied the girl. \"You\\'ll just love the folks in Oz, whenyou get acquainted. What time is it, Mr. Wizard?\"The little man looked at his watch--a big silver one that he carried inhis vest pocket. \"Half-past three,\" he said. Then Jim suddenly asked:\"Are there any horses in Oz?\"\"Only one,\" replied Dorothy, \"and he\\'s a sawhorse. Princess Ozma once brought him to life with a witch-powder,when she was a boy. \"\"Was Ozma once a boy?\" asked Zeb, wonderingly. \"Yes; a wicked witch enchanted her, so she could not rule her kingdom. But she\\'s a girl now, and the sweetest, loveliest girl in all theworld. \"\"A sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on,\" remarked Jim, with a sniff. \"It is when it\\'s not alive,\" acknowledged the girl. I\\'ll race the miserable wooden donkey any day in the week!\" criedthe cab-horse. Dorothy did not reply to that. She felt that Jim would know more aboutthe Saw-Horse later on. The time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers, but finally theWizard announced that four o\\'clock had arrived, and Dorothy caught upthe kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to thefar-away, invisible Ozma. \"Nothing seems to happen,\" said Zeb, doubtfully. \"Oh, we must give Ozma time to put on the Magic Belt,\" replied the girl. She had scarcely spoken the words when she suddenly disappeared from thecave, and with her went the kitten. One moment Dorothy sat beside them with the kitten inher lap, and a moment later the horse, the piglets, the Wizard and theboy were all that remained in the underground prison. [Illustration: DOROTHY MADE THE SIGNAL.]\"I believe we will soon follow her,\" announced the Wizard, in a tone ofgreat relief; \"for I know something about the magic of the fairylandthat is called the Land of Oz. Let us be ready, for we may be sent forany minute. \"He put the piglets safely away in his pocket again and then he and Zebgot into the buggy and sat expectantly upon the seat. \"Will it hurt?\" asked the boy, in a voice that trembled a little. \"Not at all,\" replied the Wizard. \"It will all happen as quick as awink. \"And that was the way it did happen. The cab-horse gave a nervous start and Zeb began to rub his eyes to makesure he was not asleep. Zeb shook the reins to rouse the cab-horse from his stupor of amazement,for the people were beginning to gather around and stare at thestrangers. \"Gid-dap!\" cried the boy, and at the word Jim slowly trotted into thecourtyard and drew the buggy along the jewelled driveway to the greatentrance of the royal palace. [Illustration]CHAPTER 15. \"The little man looked at her closely and then took both the maiden\\'shands in his and shook them cordially. \"On my word,\" he exclaimed, \"it\\'s little Jellia Jamb--as pert and prettyas ever! \"\"Why not, Mr. Wizard?\" asked Jellia, bowing low. \"But I\\'m afraid youcannot rule the Emerald City, as you used to, because we now have abeautiful Princess whom everyone loves dearly. \"\"And the people will not willingly part with her,\" added a tall soldierin a Captain-General\\'s uniform. \"Did you not wear green whiskers at one time?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said the soldier; \"but I shaved them off long ago, and since thenI have risen from a private to be the Chief General of the RoyalArmies. \"\"That\\'s nice,\" said the little man. cried all the servants, and itpleased the Wizard to note the respect with which the royal retainersbowed before him. His fame had not been forgotten in the Land of Oz, byany means. \"Where is Dorothy?\" enquired Zeb, anxiously, as he left the buggy andstood beside his friend the little Wizard. \"She is with the Princess Ozma, in the private rooms of the palace,\"replied Jellia Jamb. The boy looked around him with wondering eyes. \"What\\'s to become of me?\" asked the horse, uneasily. He had seenconsiderable of life in the cities in his younger days, and knew thatthis regal palace was no place for him. It perplexed even Jellia Jamb, for a time, to know what to do with theanimal. The green maiden was much astonished at the sight of so unusuala creature, for horses were unknown in this Land; but those who lived inthe Emerald City were apt to be astonished by queer sights, so afterinspecting the cab-horse and noting the mild look in his big eyes thegirl decided not to be afraid of him. \"There are no stables here,\" said the Wizard, \"unless some have beenbuilt since I went away. \"\"We have never needed them before,\" answered Jellia; \"for the Sawhorselives in a room of the palace, being much smaller and more natural inappearance than this great beast you have brought with you. \"\"Do you mean that I\\'m a freak?\" asked Jim, angrily. \"Oh, no,\" she hastened to say, \"there may be many more like you in theplace you came from, but in Oz any horse but a Sawhorse is unusual. \"This mollified Jim a little, and after some thought the green maidendecided to give the cab-horse a room in the palace, such a big buildinghaving many rooms that were seldom in use. So Zeb unharnessed Jim, and several of the servants then led the horsearound to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that hecould have all to himself. Then Jellia said to the Wizard:\"Your own room--which was back of the great Throne Room--has been vacantever since you left us. Would you like it again? \"\"Yes, indeed!\" returned the little man. \"It will seem like being at homeagain, for I lived in that room for many, many years. \"He knew the way to it, and a servant followed him, carrying his satchel. In the closets he discovered many fancy costumes of richvelvets and brocades, and one of the attendants told him to dresshimself in any of the clothes that pleased him and to be prepared todine with the Princess and Dorothy in an hour\\'s time. He was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence ofthe Princess; he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room moredainty and attractive than it was splendid. Here he found Dorothy seatedbeside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stoppedsuddenly with a gasp of admiration. But Dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friend\\'s hand, drawing himimpulsively toward the lovely Princess, who smiled most graciously uponher guest. Then the Wizard entered, and his presence relieved the boy\\'sembarrassment. The little man was clothed in black velvet, with manysparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast; but his bald head andwrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive. Ozma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built theEmerald City and united the Munchkins, Gillikins, Quadlings and Winkiesinto one people; so when they were all four seated at the dinner tablethe Princess said:\"Please tell me, Mr. Wizard, whether you called yourself Oz after thisgreat country, or whether you believe my country is called Oz after you. It is a matter that I have long wished to enquire about, because you areof a strange race and my own name is Ozma. No one, I am sure, is betterable to explain this mystery than you. \"\"That is true,\" answered the little Wizard; \"therefore it will give mepleasure to explain my connection with your country. In the first place,I must tell you that I was born in Omaha, and my father, who was apolitician, named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman HenkleEmmannuel Ambroise Diggs, Diggs being the last name because he couldthink of no more to go before it. When I grew up Ijust called myself O. Z., because the other initials were P-I-N-H-E-A-D;and that spelled \\'pinhead,\\' which was a reflection on my intelligence. \"\"Surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short,\" said Ozma,sympathetically. \"But didn\\'t you cut it almost too short?\"\"Perhaps so,\" replied the Wizard. \"When a young man I ran away from homeand joined a circus. \"\"What does that mean?\" asked the Princess. \"Throwing my voice into any object I pleased, to make it appear that theobject was speaking instead of me. \"One day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the desertsto this beautiful country. When the people saw me come from the sky theynaturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before me. Itold them I was a Wizard, and showed them some easy tricks that amazedthem; and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they calledme Oz. \"\"Now I begin to understand,\" said the Princess, smiling. So when Dorothywas first blown to this place by a cyclone I arranged to go away withher in a balloon; but the balloon escaped too soon and carried me backalone. After many adventures I reached Omaha, only to find that all myold friends were dead or had moved away. \"\"That is quite a history,\" said Ozma; \"but there is a little morehistory about the Land of Oz that you do not seem to understand--perhapsfor the reason that no one ever told it you. Many years before you camehere this Land was united under one Ruler, as it is now, and the Ruler\\'sname was always \\'Oz\\', which means in our language \\'Great and Good\\'; or,if the Ruler happened to be a woman, her name was always \\'Ozma.\\' Butonce upon a time four Witches leagued together to depose the king andrule the four parts of the kingdom themselves; so when the Ruler, mygrandfather, was hunting one day, one Wicked Witch named Mombi stole himand carried him away, keeping him a close prisoner. That was why the people were so glad to see you, and why theythought from your initials that you were their rightful ruler. \"\"But, at that time,\" said the Wizard, thoughtfully, \"there were two GoodWitches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land. \"\"Yes,\" replied Ozma, \"because a good Witch had conquered Mombi in theNorth and Glinda the Good had conquered the evil Witch in the South. ButMombi was still my grandfather\\'s jailor, and afterward my father\\'sjailor. When I was born she transformed me into a boy, hoping that noone would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess ofthe Land of Oz. But I escaped from her and am now the Ruler of mypeople. \"\"I am very glad of that,\" said the Wizard, \"and hope you will considerme one of your most faithful and devoted subjects. \"\"We owe a great deal to the Wonderful Wizard,\" continued the Princess,\"for it was you who built this splendid Emerald City. \"\"Your people built it,\" he answered. \"I only bossed the job, as we sayin Omaha. \"\"But you ruled it wisely and well for many years,\" said she, \"and madethe people proud of your magical art. So, as you are now too old towander abroad and work in a circus, I offer you a home here as long asyou live. You shall be the Official Wizard of my kingdom, and be treatedwith every respect and consideration. \"\"I accept your kind offer with gratitude, gracious Princess,\" the littleman said, in a soft voice, and they could all see that tear-drops werestanding in his keen old eyes. It meant a good deal to him to secure ahome like this. \"He\\'s only a humbug Wizard, though,\" said Dorothy, smiling at him. \"And that is the safest kind of a Wizard to have,\" replied Ozma,promptly. \"Oz can do some good tricks, humbug or no humbug,\" announced Zeb, whowas now feeling more at ease. \"He shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow,\" said the Princess. \"I havesent messengers to summon all of Dorothy\\'s old friends to meet her andgive her welcome, and they ought to arrive very soon, now. \"Indeed, the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow,to hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to seeher again. \"How are your brains?\" enquired the little humbug, as he grasped thesoft, stuffed hands of his old friend. \"Working finely,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"[Illustration: DOROTHY AND OZMA.]\"How long did you rule the Emerald City, after I left here?\" was thenext question. \"Quite awhile, until I was conquered by a girl named General Jinjur. Dorothy sprangforward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms, uttering at the sametime a glad cry. \"Oh, Billina!\" she said; \"how fat and sleek you\\'ve grown. \"\"Why shouldn\\'t I?\" asked the hen, in a sharp, clear voice. \"I live onthe fat of the land--don\\'t I, Ozma?\"\"You have everything you wish for,\" said the Princess. She nestled herself comfortably in Dorothy\\'slap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped up with asharp claw fiercely bared to strike Billina a blow. But the little girlgave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped down againwithout daring to scratch. \"How horrid of you, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy. \"Is that the way to treat myfriends? \"\"You have queer friends, seems to me,\" replied the kitten, in a surlytone. \"Seems to me the same way,\" said Billina, scornfully, \"if that beastlycat is one of them. said Dorothy, sternly. \"I won\\'t have any quarrelling in theLand of Oz, I can tell you! Everybody lives in peace here, and loveseverybody else; and unless you two, Billina and Eureka, make up and befriends, I\\'ll take my Magic Belt and wish you both home again,_immejitly_. So, there!\"They were both much frightened at the threat, and promised meekly to begood. But it was never noticed that they became very warm friends, forall of that. And now the Tin Woodman arrived, his body most beautifullynickle-plated, so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of theroom. The Tin Woodman loved Dorothy most tenderly, and welcomed with joythe return of the little old Wizard. \"Sir,\" said he to the latter, \"I never can thank you enough for theexcellent heart you once gave me. It has made me many friends, I assureyou, and it beats as kindly and lovingly today as it ever did. \"\"I\\'m glad to hear that,\" said the Wizard. \"I was afraid it would getmoldy in that tin body of yours. \"\"Not at all,\" returned Nick Chopper. But he becamenervous again when the next visitor was announced. ,\" said Princess Ozma, \"is my friend Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.,who assisted me one time when I was in great distress, and is now theDean of the Royal College of Athletic Science. \"\"Ah,\" said the Wizard; \"I\\'m pleased to meet so distinguished apersonage. \"\"H. M.,\" said the Woggle-Bug, pompously, \"means Highly Magnified; and T.E. means Thoroughly Educated. \"\"How well you disguise it,\" said the Wizard. \"But I don\\'t doubt yourword in the least. \"\"Nobody doubts it, sir,\" replied the Woggle-Bug, and drawing a book fromits pocket the strange insect turned its back on the company and satdown in a corner to read. [Illustration]CHAPTER 16. JIM, THE CAB-HORSEJim the Cab-horse found himself in possession of a large room with agreen marble floor and carved marble wainscoting, which was so statelyin its appearance that it would have awed anyone else. Then they told him dinner would be served directly and he replied thatthey could not serve it too quickly to suit his convenience. First theybrought him a steaming bowl of soup, which the horse eyed in dismay. \"Take that stuff away!\" \"Do you take me for asalamander?\"They obeyed at once, and next served a fine large turbot on a silverplatter, with drawn gravey poured over it. \"Fish!\" cried Jim, with a sniff. \"Do you take me for a tom-cat? Awaywith it! \"Well, well!\" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked. Is there nothing that is decent toeat in this palace? \"The trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward, who came in haste andsaid:\"What would your Highness like for dinner? \"\"Highness!\" repeated Jim, who was unused to such titles. \"You are at least six feet high, and that is higher than any otheranimal in this country,\" said the Steward. \"Well, my Highness would like some oats,\" declared the horse. We have no whole oats,\" the Steward replied, with muchdefference. \"But there is any quantity of oatmeal, which we often cookfor breakfast. Oatmeal is a breakfast dish,\" added the Steward, humbly. \"I\\'ll make it a dinner dish,\" said Jim. \"Fetch it on, but don\\'t cook it,as you value your life. \"You see, the respect shown the worn-out old cab-horse made him a littlearrogant, and he forgot he was a guest, never having been treatedotherwise than as a servant since the day he was born, until his arrivalin the Land of Oz. But the royal attendants did not heed the animal\\'sill temper. They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water, andJim ate it with much relish. Then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horseslept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life. The Sawhorse stopped atthe same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding eyes,which were mere knots in the log that formed its body. The ends of the wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold,and the saddle of the Princess Ozma, which was of red leather set withsparkling diamonds, was strapped to the clumsy body. Then Jim exclaimed:\"For goodness sake, what sort of a being are you?\"\"I\\'m a Sawhorse,\" replied the other. \"Oh; I believe I\\'ve heard of you,\" said the cab-horse; \"but you areunlike anything that I expected to see. But a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to bealive. \"\"I couldn\\'t help it,\" returned the other, rather crestfallen. \"Ozmasprinkled me with a magic powder, and I just had to live. I know I\\'m notmuch account; but I\\'m the only horse in all the Land of Oz, so \"\"You, a horse! \"\"Oh, not a real one, of course. There are no real horses here at all. But I\\'m a splendid imitation of one.\" he cried. \"Behold a real horse!\"The wooden animal gave a start, and then examined the other intently. \"Is it possible that you are a Real Horse?\" he murmured. \"Not only possible, but true,\" replied Jim, who was gratified by theimpression he had created. \"It is proved by my fine points. For example,look at the long hairs on my tail, with which I can whisk away theflies. \"\"The flies never trouble me,\" said the Saw-Horse. And notice my great strong teeth, with which I nibble the grass. \"\"It is not necessary for me to eat,\" observed the Saw-horse. \"Also examine my broad chest, which enables me to draw deep, fullbreaths,\" said Jim, proudly. \"I have no need to breathe,\" returned the other. \"No; you miss many pleasures,\" remarked the cab-horse, pityingly. You may be an imitation of a horse, butyou\\'re a mighty poor one. \"\"Oh, I cannot hope ever to be like you,\" sighed the Sawhorse. \"But I amglad to meet at last a Real Horse. You are certainly the most beautifulcreature I ever beheld. \"This praise won Jim completely. Said he:\"Your chief fault, my friend, is in being made of wood, and that Isuppose you cannot help. Real horses, like myself, are made of flesh andblood and bones. \"\"I can see the bones all right,\" replied the Sawhorse, \"and they areadmirable and distinct. Also I can see the flesh. But the blood, Isuppose, is tucked away inside. \"\"Exactly,\" said Jim. \"What good is it?\" asked the Sawhorse. Jim did not know, but he would not tell the Sawhorse that. \"If anything cuts me,\" he replied, \"the blood runs out to show where Iam cut. You, poor thing! cannot even bleed when you are hurt. \"\"But I am never hurt,\" said the Sawhorse. \"Once in a while I get brokenup some, but I am easily repaired and put in good order again. And Inever feel a break or a splinter in the least. \"Jim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to feelpain; but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided hewould not change places with it under any circumstances. \"How did you happen to be shod with gold?\" he asked. \"Princess Ozma did that,\" was the reply; \"and it saves my legs fromwearing out. We\\'ve had a good many adventures together, Ozma and I, andshe likes me. \"The cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and aneigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf. For around the cornerhad come two enormous savage beasts, treading so lightly that they wereupon him before he was aware of their presence. Jim was in the act ofplunging down the path to escape when the Sawhorse cried out:\"Stop, my brother! Stop, Real Horse! These are friends, and will do youno harm. \"Jim hesitated, eyeing the beasts fearfully. One was an enormous Lionwith clear, intelligent eyes, a tawney mane bushy and well kept, and abody like yellow plush. The other was a great Tiger with purple stripesaround his lithe body, powerful limbs, and eyes that showed through thehalf closed lids like coals of fire. The huge forms of these monarchs ofthe forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutestheart, and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them. But the Sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone, saying,\"This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiantKing of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of PrincessOzma. These royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy and have cometo the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our fairyland. He bowed his headwith as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage lookingbeasts, who in return nodded in a friendly way. \"Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal?\" asked the Sawhorseadmiringly. \"That is doubtless a matter of taste,\" returned the Lion. \"In the foresthe would be thought ungainly, because his face is stretched out and hisneck is uselessly long. His joints, I notice, are swollen and overgrown,and he lacks flesh and is old in years. \"\"And dreadfully tough,\" added the Hungry Tiger, in a sad voice. \"Myconscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the RealHorse. \"\"I\\'m glad of that,\" said Jim; \"for I, also, have a conscience, and ittells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof. The Tiger seemed to smile, and winked one eye slowly. \"You have a good conscience, friend Horse,\" it said, \"and if you attendto its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm. \"\"Any friend of Dorothy,\" remarked the Cowardly Lion, \"must be ourfriend, as well. So let us cease this talk of skull crushing andconverse upon more pleasant subjects. Have you breakfasted, Sir Horse?\"\"Not yet,\" replied Jim. \"But here is plenty of excellent clover, so ifyou will excuse me I will eat now. \"\"He\\'s a vegetarian,\" remarked the Tiger, as the horse began to munch theclover. \"If I could eat grass I would not need a conscience, for nothingcould then tempt me to devour babies and lambs. \"Just then Dorothy, who had risen early and heard the voices of theanimals, ran out to greet her old friends. By the time they had indulged in a good talk and Dorothy had told themall about the awful earthquake and her recent adventures, the breakfastbell rang from the palace and the little girl went inside to join herhuman comrades. As she entered the great hall a voice called out, in arather harsh tone:\"What! are _you_ here again? \"\"Yes, I am,\" she answered, looking all around to see where the voicecame from. \"What brought you back?\" was the next question, and Dorothy\\'s eye restedon an antlered head hanging on the wall just over the fireplace, andcaught its lips in the act of moving. \"Good gracious!\" she exclaimed. \"\"So I am,\" replied the head. \"But once on a time I was part of the Gump,which Ozma sprinkled with the Powder of Life. I was then for a time theHead of the finest Flying Machine that was ever known to exist, and wedid many wonderful things. Afterward the Gump was taken apart and I wasput back on this wall; but I can still talk when I feel in the mood,which is not often. \"\"It\\'s very strange,\" said the girl. \"\"That I have forgotten,\" replied the Gump\\'s Head, \"and I do not think itis of much importance. But here comes Ozma; so I\\'d better hush up, forthe Princess doesn\\'t like me to chatter since she changed her name fromTip to Ozma. \"Just then the girlish Ruler of Oz opened the door and greeted Dorothywith a good-morning kiss. The little Princess seemed fresh and rosy andin good spirits. \"Breakfast is served, dear,\" she said, \"and I am hungry. So don\\'t let uskeep it waiting a single minute. \"[Illustration][Illustration: JIM STOOD TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF.] CHAPTER 17. So first there was to be a grand procession through the streets, afterwhich the little old man was requested to perform some of his wizardriesin the great Throne Room of the palace. Just behind the royal standard-bearers came the Princess Ozma in herroyal chariot, which was of gold encrusted with emeralds and diamondsset in exquisite designs. The chariot was drawn on this occasion by theCowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, who were decorated with immense pinkand blue bows. In the chariot rode Ozma and Dorothy, the former insplendid raiment and wearing her royal coronet, while the little Kansasgirl wore around her waist the Magic Belt she had once captured from theNome King. Following the chariot came the Scarecrow mounted on the Sawhorse, andthe people cheered him almost as loudly as they did their lovely Ruler. Behind him stalked with regular, jerky steps, the famous machine-mancalled Tik-tok, who had been wound up by Dorothy for the occasion. Hereally belonged to the Kansas girl, who had much respect for histhoughts after they had been properly wound and set going; but as thecopper man would be useless in any place but a fairy country Dorothy hadleft him in charge of Ozma, who saw that he was suitably cared for. Jim and the buggy followed, the oldcab-horse being driven by Zeb while the Wizard stood up on the seat andbowed his bald head right and left in answer to the cheers of thepeople, who crowded thick about him. Taken altogether the procession was a grand success, and when it hadreturned to the palace the citizens crowded into the great Throne Roomto see the Wizard perform his tricks. The first thing the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white pigletfrom underneath his hat and pretend to pull it apart, making two. Thisact he repeated until all of the nine tiny piglets were visible, andthey were so glad to get out of his pocket that they ran around in avery lively manner. The pretty little creatures would have been anovelty anywhere, so the people were as amazed and delighted at theirappearance as even the Wizard could have desired. When he had made themall disappear again Ozma declared she was sorry they were gone, for she So the Wizard pretended to takeone of the piglets out of the hair of the Princess (while really heslyly took it from his inside pocket) and Ozma smiled joyously as thecreature nestled in her arms, and she promised to have an emerald collarmade for its fat neck and to keep the little squealer always at hand toamuse her. In his little room back of the Throne Room the Wizard had found a lot ofthings he had left behind him when he went away in the balloon, for noone had occupied the apartment in his absence. So he followed the trick of the nine tinypiglets with several other wonderful feats that greatly delighted hisaudience and the people did not seem to care a bit whether the littleman was a humbug Wizard or not, so long as he succeeded in amusing them. They applauded all his tricks and at the end of the performance beggedhim earnestly not to go away again and leave them. \"In that case,\" said the little man, gravely, \"I will cancel all of myengagements before the crowned heads of Europe and America and devotemyself to the people of Oz, for I love you all so well that I can denyyou nothing. \"After the people had been dismissed with this promise our friends joinedPrincess Ozma at an elaborate luncheon in the palace, where even theTiger and the Lion were sumptuously fed and Jim the Cab-horse ate hisoatmeal out of a golden bowl with seven rows of rubies, sapphires anddiamonds set around the rim of it. You may be sure the folks of Oz did their best with such adistinguished company watching them, and finally Zeb offered to wrestlewith a little Munchkin who seemed to be the champion. In appearance hewas twice as old as Zeb, for he had long pointed whiskers and wore apeaked hat with little bells all around the brim of it, which tinkledgaily as he moved. But although the Munchkin was hardly tall enough tocome to Zeb\\'s shoulder he was so strong and clever that he laid the boythree times on his back with apparent ease. Zeb was greatly astonished at his defeat, and when the pretty Princessjoined her people in laughing at him he proposed a boxing-match with theMunchkin, to which the little Ozite readily agreed. But the first timethat Zeb managed to give him a sharp box on the ears the Munchkin satdown upon the ground and cried until the tears ran down his whiskers,because he had been hurt. This made Zeb laugh, in turn, and the boyfelt comforted to find that Ozma laughed as merrily at her weepingsubject as she had at him. Just then the Scarecrow proposed a race between the Sawhorse and theCab-horse; and although all the others were delighted at the suggestionthe Sawhorse drew back, saying:\"Such a race would not be fair. \"\"Of course not,\" added Jim, with a touch of scorn; \"those little woodenlegs of yours are not half as long as my own. \"\"It isn\\'t that,\" said the Sawhorse, modestly; \"but I never tire, and youdo. \"\"Bah!\" cried Jim, looking with great disdain at the other; \"do youimagine for an instant that such a shabby imitation of a horse as youare can run as fast as I? \"\"I don\\'t know, I\\'m sure,\" replied the Sawhorse. \"That is what we are trying to find out,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"Theobject of a race is to see who can win it--or at least that is what myexcellent brains think. \"\"Once, when I was young,\" said Jim, \"I was a race horse, and defeatedall who dared run against me. I was born in Kentucky, you know, whereall the best and most aristocratic horses come from. \"\"But you\\'re old, now, Jim,\" suggested Zeb. \"Old! Why, I feel like a colt today,\" replied Jim. \"I only wish therewas a real horse here for me to race with. I\\'d show the people a finesight, I can tell you. \"\"Then why not race with the Sawhorse?\" enquired the Scarecrow. \"He\\'s afraid,\" said Jim. \"Oh, no,\" answered the Sawhorse. \"I merely said it wasn\\'t fair. But ifmy friend the Real Horse is willing to undertake the race I am quiteready. \"When I say \\'Go!\\'\" Zeb called to them, \"you must dig out and race untilyou reach those three trees you see over yonder. Then circle \\'round themand come back again. The first one that passes the place where thePrincess sits shall be named the winner. Are you ready?\"\"I suppose I ought to give the wooden dummy a good start of me,\" growledJim. \"Never mind that,\" said the Sawhorse. \"I\\'ll do the best I can. cried Zeb; and at the word the two horses leaped forward and therace was begun. [Illustration: THE WIZARD TOOK A PIGLET FROM OZMA\\'S HAIR.] Its wooden legsmoved so fast that their twinkling could scarcely be seen, andalthough so much smaller than the cab-horse it covered the ground muchfaster. Before they had reached the trees the Sawhorse was far ahead,and the wooden animal returned to the starting place and was beinglustily cheered by the Ozites before Jim came panting up to the canopywhere the Princess and her friends were seated. [Illustration: THE HUNGRY TIGER TEACHES JIM A LESSON.] The beast struckJim full on his shoulder and sent the astonished cab-horse rolling overand over, amid shouts of delight from the spectators, who had beenhorrified by the ungracious act he had been guilty of. When Jim came to himself and sat upon his haunches he found the CowardlyLion crouched on one side of him and the Hungry Tiger on the other, andtheir eyes were glowing like balls of fire. \"I beg your pardon, I\\'m sure,\" said Jim, meekly. \"I was wrong to kickthe Sawhorse, and I am sorry I became angry at him. He has won the race,and won it fairly; but what can a horse of flesh do against a tirelessbeast of wood? \"Hearing this apology the Tiger and the Lion stopped lashing their tailsand retreated with dignified steps to the side of the Princess. Then the Tin Woodman cut a straight and strong limb from a tree with hisgleaming axe and made a new leg and a new ear for the Sawhorse; and whenthey had been securely fastened in place Princess Ozma took the coronetfrom her own head and placed it upon that of the winner of the race. Said she:\"My friend, I reward you for your swiftness by proclaiming you Prince ofHorses, whether of wood or of flesh; and hereafter all other horses--inthe Land of Oz, at least--must be considered imitations, and you thereal Champion of your race. \"I ought to be a fairy,\" grumbled Jim, as he slowly drew the buggy home;\"for to be just an ordinary horse in a fairy country is to be of noaccount whatever. It\\'s no place for us, Zeb. \"\"It\\'s lucky we got here, though,\" said the boy; and Jim thought of thedark cave, and agreed with him. [Illustration]CHAPTER 18. THE TRIAL OF EUREKA THE KITTENSeveral days of festivity and merry-making followed, for such oldfriends did not often meet and there was much to be told and talked overbetween them, and many amusements to be enjoyed in this delightfulcountry. Ozma was happy to have Dorothy beside her, for girls of her own age withwhom it was proper for the Princess to associate were very few, andoften the youthful Ruler of Oz was lonely for lack of companionship. It was the third morning after Dorothy\\'s arrival, and she was sittingwith Ozma and their friends in a reception room, talking over old times,when the Princess said to her maid:\"Please go to my boudoir, Jellia, and get the white piglet I left on thedressing-table. \"The piglet is not there, your Highness,\" said she. \"Not there!\" exclaimed Ozma. \"Are you sure? \"\"I have hunted in every part of the room,\" the maid replied. \"Was not the door closed?\" asked the Princess. \"Yes, your Highness; I am sure it was; for when I opened it Dorothy\\'swhite kitten crept out and ran up the stairs. \"Hearing this, Dorothy and the Wizard exchanged startled glances, forthey remembered how often Eureka had longed to eat a piglet. The littlegirl jumped up at once. \"Come, Ozma,\" she said, anxiously; \"let us go ourselves to search forthe piglet. \"So the two went to the dressing-room of the Princess and searchedcarefully in every corner and among the vases and baskets and ornamentsthat stood about the pretty boudoir. But not a trace could they find ofthe tiny creature they sought. Dorothy was nearly weeping, by this time, while Ozma was angry andindignant. When they returned to the others the Princess said:\"There is little doubt that my pretty piglet has been eaten by thathorrid kitten, and if that is true the offender must be punished. \"\"I don\\'t b\\'lieve Eureka would do such a dreadful thing!\" cried Dorothy,much distressed. \"Go and get my kitten, please, Jellia, and we\\'ll hearwhat she has to say about it. \"The green maiden hastened away, but presently returned and said:\"The kitten will not come. She threatened to scratch my eyes out if Itouched her. \"\"Where is she?\" asked Dorothy. \"Under the bed in your own room,\" was the reply. So Dorothy ran to her room and found the kitten under the bed. \"Come here, Eureka!\" she said. \"I won\\'t,\" answered the kitten, in a surly voice. \"Oh, Eureka! Why are you so bad?\"The kitten did not reply. \"If you don\\'t come to me, right away,\" continued Dorothy, gettingprovoked, \"I\\'ll take my Magic Belt and wish you in the Country of theGurgles. \"\"Why do you want me?\" asked Eureka, disturbed by this threat. \"You must go to Princess Ozma. She wants to talk to you. \"\"All right,\" returned the kitten, creeping out. \"I\\'m not afraid ofOzma--or anyone else. \"Dorothy carried her in her arms back to where the others sat in grievedand thoughtful silence. \"Tell me, Eureka,\" said the Princess, gently: \"did you eat my prettypiglet? \"\"I won\\'t answer such a foolish question,\" asserted Eureka, with a snarl. \"Oh, yes you will, dear,\" Dorothy declared. So, if you areinnocent, Eureka, you must tell the Princess how you came to be in herroom, and what has become of the piglet. \"\"Who accuses me?\" asked the kitten, defiantly. \"No one,\" answered Ozma. The fact isthat I left my little pet in my dressing-room lying asleep upon thetable; and you must hove stolen in without my knowing it. \"\"That\\'s none of my business,\" growled the kitten. \"Don\\'t be impudent, Eureka,\" admonished Dorothy. \"It is you who are impudent,\" said Eureka, \"for accusing me of such acrime when you can\\'t prove it except by guessing. \"Ozma was now greatly incensed by the kitten\\'s conduct. She summoned herCaptain-General, and when the long, lean officer appeared she said:\"Carry this cat away to prison, and keep her in safe confinement untilshe is tried by law for the crime of murder.\"So the Captain-General took Eureka from the arms of the now weepingDorothy and in spite of the kitten\\'s snarls and scratches carried itaway to prison. \"What shall we do now?\" asked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, for such acrime had cast a gloom over all the company. \"I will summon the Court to meet in the Throne Room at three o\\'clock,\"replied Ozma. \"I myself will be the judge, and the kitten shall have afair trial. \"\"What will happen if she is guilty?\" asked Dorothy. \"She must die,\" answered the Princess. \"Nine times?\" enquired the Scarecrow. \"As many times as is necessary,\" was the reply. \"I will ask the TinWoodman to defend the prisoner, because he has such a kind heart I amsure he will do his best to save her. And the Woggle-Bug shall be thePublic Accuser, because he is so learned that no one can deceive him. \"\"Who will be the jury?\" asked the Tin Woodman. [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF THE WIZARD OF OZ.]\"There ought to be several animals on the jury,\" said Ozma, \"becauseanimals understand each other better than we people understand them. So the jury shall consist of the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, Jimthe Cab-horse, the Yellow Hen, the Scarecrow, the Wizard, Tik-tok theMachine Man, the Sawhorse and Zeb of Hugson\\'s Ranch. That makes the ninewhich the law requires, and all my people shall be admitted to hear thetestimony. But it must be stated that the people of that Landwere generally so well-behaved that there was not a single lawyeramongst them, and it had been years since any Ruler had sat in judgmentupon an offender of the law. The Wizard, when he returned to his own room, was exceedinglythoughtful. He had no doubt Eureka had eaten his piglet, but he realizedthat a kitten cannot be depended upon at all times to act properly,since its nature is to destroy small animals and even birds for food,and the tame cat that we keep in our houses today is descended from thewild cat of the jungle--a very ferocious creature, indeed. The Wizardknew that if Dorothy\\'s pet was found guilty and condemned to death thelittle girl would be made very unhappy; so, although he grieved over thepiglet\\'s sad fate as much as any of them, he resolved to save Eureka\\'slife. Sending for the Tin Woodman the Wizard took him into a corner andwhispered:\"My friend, it is your duty to defend the white kitten and try to saveher, but I fear you will fail because Eureka has long wished to eat apiglet, to my certain knowledge, and my opinion is that she has beenunable to resist the temptation. Yet her disgrace and death would notbring back the piglet, but only serve to make Dorothy unhappy. So Iintend to prove the kitten\\'s innocence by a trick. \"He drew from his inside pocket one of the eight tiny piglets that wereremaining and continued:\"This creature you must hide in some safe place, and if the jury decidesthat Eureka is guilty you may then produce this piglet and claim it isthe one that was lost. \"\"I do not like to deceive my friends,\" replied the Tin Woodman; \"still,my kind heart urges me to save Eureka\\'s life, and I can usually trust myheart to do the right thing. So I will do as you say, friend Wizard. CHAPTER 19. THE WIZARD PERFORMS ANOTHER TRICKAt three o\\'clock the Throne Room was crowded with citizens, men, womenand children being eager to witness the great trial. Princess Ozma, dressed in her most splendid robes of state, sat in themagnificent emerald throne, with her jewelled sceptre in her hand andher sparkling coronet upon her fair brow. At her right sat the queerly assorted Jury--animals, animateddummies and people--all gravely prepared to listen to what was said. Thekitten had been placed in a large cage just before the throne, where shesat upon her haunches and gazed through the bars at the crowds aroundher, with seeming unconcern. \"\"Do you mean my kitten must be put in a grave?\" asked Dorothy. \"Don\\'t interrupt, little girl ,\" said the Woggle-Bug. \"When I get mythoughts arranged in good order I do not like to have anything upsetthem or throw them into confusion. \"\"If your thoughts were any good they wouldn\\'t become confused,\" remarkedthe Scarecrow, earnestly. \"My thoughts are always----\"\"Is this a trial of thoughts, or of kittens?\" demanded the Woggle-Bug. \"It\\'s a trial of one kitten,\" replied the Scarecrow; \"but your manner isa trial to us all. \"\"The criminal who now sits before the court licking her paws,\" resumedthe Woggle-Bug, \"has long desired to unlawfully eat the fat piglet,which was no bigger than a mouse. I can see her, in my mind\\'seye----\"\"What\\'s that?\" asked the Scarecrow. \"I say I can see her in my mind\\'s eye----\"\"The mind has no eye,\" declared the Scarecrow. \"\"Your Highness,\" cried the Woggle-Bug, appealing to Ozma, \"have I amind\\'s eye, or haven\\'t I? \"\"If you have, it is invisible,\" said the Princess. \"Very true,\" returned the Woggle-Bug, bowing. \"I say I see the criminal,in my mind\\'s eye, creeping stealthily into the room of our Ozma andsecreting herself, when no one was looking, until the Princess had goneaway and the door was closed. Then the murderer was alone with herhelpless victim, the fat piglet, and I see her pounce upon the innocentcreature and eat it up----\"\"Are you still seeing with your mind\\'s eye?\" enquired the Scarecrow. \"Of course; how else could I see it? And we know the thing is true,because since the time of that interview there is no piglet to be foundanywhere. \"[Illustration: EUREKA IN COURT.]\"I suppose, if the cat had been gone, instead of the piglet, your mind\\'seye would see the piglet eating the cat,\" suggested the Scarecrow. Then the Princessspoke in a stern voice:\"Prisoner, what have you to say for yourself? Are you guilty, or notguilty?\"\"Why, that\\'s for you to find out,\" replied Eureka. \"If you can prove I\\'mguilty, I\\'ll be willing to die nine times, but a mind\\'s eye is no proof,because the Woggle-Bug has no mind to see with. \"\"Never mind, dear,\" said Dorothy. Then the Tin Woodman arose and said:\"Respected Jury and dearly beloved Ozma, I pray you not to judge thisfeline prisoner unfeelingly. I do not think the innocent kitten can beguilty, and surely it is unkind to accuse a luncheon of being a murder. Eureka is the sweet pet of a lovely little girl whom we all admire, andgentleness and innocence are her chief virtues. Look at the kitten\\'sintelligent eyes;\" (here Eureka closed her eyes sleepily) \"gaze at hersmiling countenance!\" (here Eureka snarled and showed her teeth) \"markthe tender pose of her soft, padded little hands!\" \"Would such agentle animal be guilty of eating a fellow creature? No; a thousandtimes, no!\"\"Oh, cut it short,\" said Eureka; \"you\\'ve talked long enough. \"\"I\\'m trying to defend you,\" remonstrated the Tin Woodman. \"Then say something sensible,\" retorted the kitten. \"Tell them it wouldbe foolish for me to eat the piglet, because I had sense enough to knowit would raise a row if I did. But don\\'t try to make out I\\'m tooinnocent to eat a fat piglet if I could do it and not be found out. Iimagine it would taste mighty good. \"\"Perhaps it would, to those who eat,\" remarked the Tin Woodman. \"Imyself, not being built to eat, have no personal experience in suchmatters. But I remember that our great poet once said:    \"\\'To eat is sweet    When hunger\\'s seat    Demands a treat    Of savory meat.\\' \"Take this into consideration, friends of the Jury, and you will readilydecide that the kitten is wrongfully accused and should be set atliberty. As for the Jury, the members whispered to each otherfor a few minutes and then they appointed the Hungry Tiger theirspokesman. The huge beast slowly arose and said:\"Kittens have no consciences, so they eat whatever pleases them. Thejury believes the white kitten known as Eureka is guilty of having eatenthe piglet owned by Princess Ozma, and recommends that she be put todeath in punishment of the crime. \"The judgment of the jury was received with great applause, althoughDorothy was sobbing miserably at the fate of her pet. The Princess wasjust about to order Eureka\\'s head chopped off with the Tin Woodman\\'s axewhen that brilliant personage once more arose and addressed her. \"Your Highness,\" said he, \"see how easy it is for a jury to be mistaken. The kitten could not have eaten your piglet--for here it is! \"He took off his funnel hat and from beneath it produced a tiny whitepiglet, which he held aloft that all might see it clearly. Ozma was delighted and exclaimed, eagerly:\"Give me my pet, Nick Chopper! \"And all the people cheered and clapped their hands, rejoicing that theprisoner had escaped death and been proved to be innocent. As the Princess held the white piglet in her arms and stroked its softhair she said: \"Let Eureka out of the cage, for she is no longer aprisoner, but our good friend. Where did you find my missing pet, NickChopper?\"\"In a room of the palace,\" he answered. \"Justice,\" remarked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, \"is a dangerous thing tomeddle with. If you hadn\\'t happened to find the piglet, Eureka wouldsurely have been executed. \"\"But justice prevailed at the last,\" said Ozma, \"for here is my pet, andEureka is once more free. \"\"I refuse to be free,\" cried the kitten, in a sharp voice, \"unless theWizard can do his trick with eight piglets. \"\"The piglet that belonged to the Princess wore an emerald collar,\" saidEureka, loudly enough for all to hear. \"So it did!\" exclaimed Ozma. \"\"Of course not; he had nine of them, altogether,\" declared Eureka; \"andI must say it was very stingy of him not to let me eat just a few. Butnow that this foolish trial is ended, I will tell you what really becameof your pet piglet. \"At this everyone in the Throne Room suddenly became quiet, and thekitten continued, in a calm, mocking tone of voice:\"I will confess that I intended to eat the little pig for my breakfast;so I crept into the room where it was kept while the Princess wasdressing and hid myself under a chair. When Ozma went away she closedthe door and left her pet on the table. Instead of keeping still, so I could eat him comfortably, he trembled sowith fear that he fell off the table into a big vase that was standingon the floor. The vase had a very small neck, and spread out at the toplike a bowl. When he returned the Princess looked downthe narrow neck of the big ornament and discovered her lost piglet, justas Eureka had said she would. Then the crowd cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten in her armsand told her how delighted she was to know that she was innocent. \"But why didn\\'t you tell us at first?\" she asked. \"It would have spoiled the fun,\" replied the kitten, yawning. CHAPTER 20. For the folks of Ozknew the kitten had tried to commit the crime, and that only an accidenthad prevented her from doing so; therefore even the Hungry Tigerpreferred not to associate with her. Eureka was forbidden to wanderaround the palace and was made to stay in confinement in Dorothy\\'s room;so she began to beg her mistress to send her to some other place whereshe could enjoy herself better. Dorothy was herself anxious to get home, so she promised Eureka theywould not stay in the Land of Oz much longer. The next evening after the trial the little girl begged Ozma to allowher to look in the enchanted picture, and the Princess readilyconsented. She took the child to her room and said: \"Make your wish,dear, and the picture will show the scene you desire to behold. \"Then Dorothy found, with the aid of the enchanted picture, that UncleHenry had returned to the farm in Kansas, and she also saw that both heand Aunt Em were dressed in mourning, because they thought their littleniece had been killed by the earthquake. \"Really,\" said the girl, anxiously, \"I must get back as soon as poss\\'bleto my own folks. \"Zeb also wanted to see his home, and although he did not find anyonemourning for him, the sight of Hugson\\'s Ranch in the picture made himlong to get back there. \"This is a fine country, and I like all the people that live in it,\" hetold Dorothy. \"But the fact is, Jim and I don\\'t seem to fit into afairyland, and the old horse has been begging me to go home again eversince he lost the race. So, if you can find a way to fix it, we\\'ll bemuch obliged to you. \"\"Ozma can do it, easily,\" replied Dorothy. \"Tomorrow morning I\\'ll go toKansas and you can go to Californy. \"[Illustration: \"I\\'M MUCH OBLIGED FOR ALL YOUR KINDNESS.\"]That last evening was so delightful that the boy will never forget it aslong as he lives. They were all together (except Eureka) in thepretty rooms of the Princess, and the Wizard did some new tricks, andthe Scarecrow told stories, and the Tin Woodman sang a love song in asonorous, metallic voice, and everybody laughed and had a good time. Then Dorothy wound up Tik-tok and he danced a jig to amuse the company,after which the Yellow Hen related some of her adventures with the NomeKing in the Land of Ev. The Princess served delicious refreshments to those who were in thehabit of eating, and when Dorothy\\'s bed time arrived the companyseparated after exchanging many friendly sentiments. Dorothy held Eureka in her arms and bade her friends a fond good-bye. \"You must come again, some time,\" said the little Wizard; and shepromised she would if she found it possible to do so. \"But Uncle Henry and Aunt Em need me to help them,\" she added, \"so Ican\\'t ever be very long away from the farm in Kansas. \"Ozma wore the Magic Belt; and, when she had kissed Dorothy farewell andhad made her wish, the little girl and her kitten disappeared in atwinkling. \"Where is she?\" asked Zeb, rather bewildered by the suddenness of it. \"Greeting her uncle and aunt in Kansas, by this time,\" returned Ozma,with a smile. \"I\\'m much obliged for all your kindness,\" said the boy, \"and verygrateful to you for saving my life and sending me home again after allthe good times I\\'ve had. Good-bye, everybody! Just ahead of them were the gates of Hugson\\'s Ranch, and UncleHugson now came out and stood with uplifted arms and wide open mouth,staring in amazement. \"Goodness gracious! he exclaimed. \"Where in theworld have you been, my lad?\"\"Why, in the world, Uncle,\" answered Zeb, with a laugh.

It should have arrived at Hugson\\'ssiding at midnight, but it was already five o\\'clock and the gray dawnwas breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to theopen shed that served for the station-house. The conductor helped her off the car and then theengineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned andmoved slowly away up the track. The reason he was so late was becauseall through the night there were times when the solid earth shook andtrembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment therails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers. Thebuggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side curtains. Presentlyhe woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly. \"Hello!\" \"She climbed into the buggy and he followed her. \"But Jim knowshis business all right--don\\'t you, Jim?\" patting the long nose of theanimal. \"Only a day. Then he started to say something to his little companion,but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from sideto side and the earth seemed to rise up before them. \"What wasthat? Zeb shook thereins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn. There was abreath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth wouldshake violently. He was notgoing very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and attimes he would tremble like a leaf. With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit, drawingthe buggy and its occupants after him. Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence theywaited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or forthe earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in itsdreadful depths. The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or anumbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floateddownward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear. She began to realizethat death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merelystarted upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer andunusual as were those she had before encountered.  The central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun. Around it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other fivebrilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, oneblue and one orange. The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.   They saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, verylike those upon the earth\\'s surface; but all the scene was splendidlycolored by the variegated lights from the six suns. \"We arefalling so slowly that we can\\'t be dashed to pieces when we land, andthis country that we are coming to seems quite pretty. \"But don\\'t let us worryover such things, Zeb; we can\\'t help ourselves just now, you know, andI\\'ve always been told it\\'s foolish to borrow trouble. \"There\\'s Eureka. It\\'s this queer light that gives herthat color. Am I talking? A near by steeple hadbeen broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it. Otherbuildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents hadhappened to mar their perfection. They began to wonder if therewere no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner world. Suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one theywere on and stepped into plain view. He was not a very large man, butwas well formed and had a beautiful face--calm and serene as the face ofa fine portrait. His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeouslycolored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the sunbeamstouched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays. The man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticedthe presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly. For a good many years Idrew a public cab in Chicago, and that\\'s enough to make anyone skinny. \"Do I? \"I can see plenty of nice gardens andfields down below us, at the edge of this city. Zeb hesitated. He was still pale and frightened, for this dreadfuladventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried. It seemed firmenough to walk upon, so he took courage and put out the other foot. His great weight made him fall faster than thechildren walked, and he passed them on the way down; but when he came tothe glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was not evenjarred. \"People began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals,and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled. \"\"How can we do that?\" It is your affair, not mine. Instantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor; then itslowly spread and ascended into the dome, disclosing a strange personageseated upon a glass throne just before Jim\\'s nose. But he had no hair at all, and allover his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharpthorns like those found on the branches of rose-bushes. My sorcery tells me so. Eh? I had let so much gas out of my balloon that I could not rise again,and in a few minutes the earth closed over my head. Sorry to have troubled you; but itcouldn\\'t be helped. There sat the thorny Sorcerer in his chair of state, and when the Wizardsaw him he began to laugh, uttering comical little chuckles. Were you ever with a circus, brother? \"I belong toBailum & Barney\\'s Great Consolidated Shows--three rings in one tent anda menagerie on the side. \"I go up in a balloon, usually, to draw the crowds to the circus. ButI\\'ve just had the bad luck to come out of the sky, skip the solid earth,and land lower down than I intended. \"But they had no handkerchiefs, either. The Wizard reached out, caught the wee creature in hishand, and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tailbetween the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart, each of the twoparts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant. The Wizard continued this surprisingperformance until nine tiny piglets were running about at his feet, allsquealing and grunting in a very comical way. This the Wizard placed underneath his hat and made a mysticsign above it. \"Why not?\" enquired the Wizard. \"About five minutes. Watch me carefully. By the time he hadattached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe,as the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect. So the Wizard lost no more time, but leaping forward he raised the sharpsword, whirled it once or twice around his head, and then gave a mightystroke that cut the body of the Sorcerer exactly in two. \"Why, he\\'s vegetable!\" Are you not vegetable, also? \"\"Certainly, sir. He is really dead now, and will wither very quickly. THE VEGETABLE KINGDOMAfter the Wizard had wiped the dampness from his sword and taken itapart and put the pieces into their leathern case again, the man withthe star ordered some of his people to carry the two halves of theSorcerer to the public gardens. \"\"Can\\'t you mend them?\" she enquired. Then they put the two halves of the Sorcerer into it and coveredhim up. It appeared that these odd people, while they were able to walk throughthe air with ease, usually moved upon the ground in the ordinary way. Inside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsomeplants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearlyreached the ground. The growing Mangaboos were of all sizes, from the blossom that had justturned into a wee baby to the full-grown and almost ripe man or woman. On some of the bushes might be seen a bud, a blossom, a baby, ahalf-grown person and a ripe one; but even those ready to pluck weremotionless and silent, as if devoid of life. \"You will notice they are all attached to theplants by the soles of their feet, and when they are quite ripe they areeasily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers of motionand speech. \"If wekeep cool and moist, and meet with no accidents, we often live for fiveyears. No, indeed. \"He led them within another but smaller circle of hedge, where grew onelarge and beautiful bush. The maiden\\'s gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds,while dainty lace-like traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves. When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty ofthe Mangaboos to her. He hesitated. \"She\\'s as perfect as she canbe. \"Ithink I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick,for he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us. But the rest of youmust be destroyed in some way, and you cannot be planted, because I donot wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country.  I have been ready for picking all the past week, butbecause you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule,you left me to stand silent upon my bush. They did not bother to cross the bridgesover the brooks, but when they came to a stream they stepped high andwalked in the air to the other side.  But I\\'ve noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries. In the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons, andseveral other unknown but delicious fruits, of which they ate heartily.  In the strict senseof the word I am not a Wizard, but only a humbug. But the pulling of them apartand pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick. \"I\\'mawfully hungry. Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold and moist asthe vegetables themselves. The only bait he could find was abright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool ifanything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try theblossom. Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearbybrook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and wascaught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sureenough, the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore,where it began to flop around in great excitement. \"But I don\\'t think that fish had anybones, because I didn\\'t feel them scratch my throat. \"I\\'m glad we are not fishes!\" \"Then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were oneor two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, andshe went to the buggy and brought them. \"They agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jimdrew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall. It was the same sort of climb oneexperiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breathwhen they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to bedoorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house. Followingthese halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and somewere furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs. But there were nobeds at all. Zeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself free,rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with Eurekanestling comfortably beside his big, boney body. Thelittle man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, andlooking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up onhis bench and yawning. I am greater than anythorn-covered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden. Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others ornot. Then he jointed together the blades of hissword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose. Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oilwhich Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a cleveridea from those commonplace things. Theglare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of thesix great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and clearly. When he lighted the oil ahundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing. Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be draggedfrom the fire, and all were so withered that it would be necessary toplant them at once. They were even permitted to occupy theHouse of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and towander in the gardens in search of food. Theysaw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing andtwisting around like a nest of great snakes. Everything the vinestouched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to haveescaped being cast among them. Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny pigletsfrom his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room toamuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found hisglass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom partof the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could. he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of theround, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyedthe sport very greatly. Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent,solemn-eyed Mangaboos. The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to thedoorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they weredriven from the room and out upon the street. Slowly but steadily theheartless Mangaboos drove them on, until they had passed through thecity and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to themountain. \"\"What would you do?\" enquired Jim. \"An instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos andkicked out his hind legs as hard as he could. A dozen of them smashedtogether and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kickedagain and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them inall directions and sending the others scattering to escape his ironheels. They tired Jim andEureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered withmashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up at lastand allow themselves to be driven to the mountain. \"This is dreadful!\" groaned Jim. \"It will be about the end of ouradventures, I guess. The Mangaboos saw her escape, and several of them caught up theirthorns and gave chase, mounting through the air after her. Some of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House ofthe Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetablepeople allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in acrowd behind them so that they could not go back again. \"I\\'d as soon die here as live muchlonger among those cruel and heartless people. Zeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns. The rays of thecolored suns were now shut out from them forever, for the last chinkshad been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the Landof the Mangaboos. \"It isn\\'t a bad road,\" observed the Wizard, \"and if we followed it itmight lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this blackpocket we are now in. Sometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazedthe sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floorwas usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without anyaccident. \"But they kept steadily moving, and just as Jim was about tired out withhis long journey the way suddenly grew lighter, and Zeb put out thelanterns to save the oil. To their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them, forall were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, hadmade their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays. Jim hastened his lagging steps at thisassurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few momentsmore they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face toface with a new and charming country. It was all laid out into lovely lawns andgardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautifuland stately trees dotting the landscape here and there. Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between theirflower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of thequaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld. None of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each hadample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it. As the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enrapturedby its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air, whichthey breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel. One was that itwas lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon was in thearched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a clear andperfect light. All appeared mysteriously deserted. With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over theloose rocks until he reached the green lawns below, where the paths andorchards and gardens began. Slowly they walked along the path toward the nearestcottage, the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim pausingat every step for another mouthful of grass. \"Here,--piggy, piggy, piggy!\" called their master, anxiously. The Wizard stooped down and put out his hand, and at once felt the smallfat body of one of his pets. \"I only hope it wasn\\'tpoison. \"But _we_ The travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage, which theypresently reached. The door stood open and a table was set inthe front room, with four chairs drawn up to it. On the table wereplates, knives and forks, and dishes of bread, meat and fruits. What do you call it? \"But we do not wish to intrude, I assure you,\" the Wizard hastened tosay. \"He draws the buggy you see fastened to him, and we ride in the buggyinstead of walking,\" she explained. \"No! \" Yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature,the dainty flowers and trees, the green fields and the clear blue of thesky. Eureka was frantic with terror, and tried toscratch and bite, so the next moment she was dropped to the floor. she gasped. As forreaching the top of the earth, I have never heard that it is possible todo that, and if you succeeded in getting there you would probably falloff. \"\"The Valley of Voe is certainly a charming place,\" resumed the Wizard;\"but we cannot be contented in any other land than our own, for long. Our greatest Champion, Overman-Anu, onceclimbed the spiral stairway and fought nine days with the Gargoylesbefore he could escape them and come back; but he could never be inducedto describe the dreadful creatures, and soon afterward a bear caughthim and ate him up. But theywere in great numbers, and the Champion could not shout much because hehad to save his breath for fighting. \"\" \"They now bade farewell to the kind but unseen people of the cottage, andafter the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shapedmountain on the opposite side of the Valley, and told them how to travelin order to reach it, they again started upon their journey. Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about, and there were manyof the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of. \"\"How _can_ we \\'scape?\" \"\"But we would be drowned!\" They did not sink at all, owing to the virtues of the strangeplant they had used, and when the buggy was in the middle of the streamthe Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim. \"Run for the river!\" shouted the Wizard, and Jim quickly freed himselffrom his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed. At once he began stabbing atthe air with his sword, and he knew that he had struck some substancebecause when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood. Thebeast was quite dead from the sword thrusts, and after a glance at itsterrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic andrushed out upon the water, for other menacing growls told him more bearswere near. \"Ifour unknown friend hadn\\'t warned us, and told us what to do, we wouldall be dead by this time. \"Jim did not make a mile a minute; but almost before they were aware ofit he drew up at the foot of the mountain, so suddenly that the Wizardand Zeb both sailed over the dashboard and landed in the softgrass--where they rolled over several times before they stopped. Directly facing the place where Jim hadstopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway. The stairswere cut in the rock inside the mountain, and they were broad and notvery steep, because they circled around like a cork-screw, and at thearched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big.     DANGER! KEEP OUT. Below them wasa vast space, at the bottom of which was a black sea with rollingbillows, through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up. Mortals who stand upon the earthand look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms, but ourfriends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the daintyfairies very clearly. \"They are the Cloud Fairies. \"In the open space between the clouds and the black, bubbling sea farbeneath, could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its wayswiftly through the air. These birds were of enormous size, and remindedZeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights. They had fierceeyes and sharp talons and beaks, and the children hoped none of themwould venture into the cavern. \"Well, I declare!\" \"They turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the centerof the cave, who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted theirattention. These were so long thatthey reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard werecarefully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid fastenedwith a bow of colored ribbon. \" But \"Well, I make Assorted Flutters for flags and bunting, and a superiorgrade of Rustles for ladies\\' silk gowns. \"May we examine some ofthese articles? Here, on abroad shelf, were several card-board boxes of various sizes, each tiedwith cotton cord. They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day, whenthere is no wind. You, sir,\" turning to the Wizard, \"ought to have thisassortment. It is a sad story, but if you will try to restrainyour tears I will tell you about it. On earth I was a manufacturer ofImported Holes for American Swiss Cheese, and I will acknowledge that Isupplied a superior article, which was in great demand. Also I madepores for porous plasters and high-grade holes for doughnuts andbuttons. Finally I invented a new Adjustable Post-hole, which I thoughtwould make my fortune. I manufactured a large quantity of thesepost-holes, and having no room in which to store them I set them all endto end and put the top one in the ground. That made an extraordinarylong hole, as you may imagine, and reached far down into the earth; and,as I leaned over it to try to see to the bottom, I lost my balance andtumbled in. Unfortunately, the hole led directly into the vast space yousee outside this mountain; but I managed to catch a point of rock thatprojected from this cavern, and so saved myself from tumbling headlonginto the black waves beneath, where the tongues of flame that dart outwould certainly have consumed me. So they politely bade him good day, and went back to the outercavern to resume their journey. \" \"\" \"Eureka yawned and stretched herself. At last, however, a dim light appeared ahead of them, which grew clearerand stronger as they advanced. \"Nonsense!\" snapped the tired Wizard. \"I\\'ve taken a look at this place, andit\\'s no fit country for real creatures to go to. \"With this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remainingsteps. The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broadplatform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyeshad ever beheld. The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hardknots from trees, worn smooth in course of time. The tree-trunkswere of coarse wood, but the leaves of the trees were shavings. These were very numerous, for the palace was thickly inhabited, and alarge group of the queer people clustered near, gazing sharply upon thestrangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway. The Gargoyles were very small of stature, being less than three feet inheight. There were many types, indeed, scarcely two being alike; butall were equally disagreeable in appearance. This noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about theGargoyles. The group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered nearthe stairs at first remained staring and motionless, glaring with evileyes at the intruders who had so suddenly appeared in their land. \"He got his satchel from the buggy and, opening it, took out two deadlylooking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just tolook at. \"If we had known we were coming we might have brought along severalother useful things,\" responded the Wizard. \"But we dropped into thisadventure rather unexpectedly. \"The Gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound oftalking, for although our friends had spoken in low tones their wordsseemed loud in the silence surrounding them. But as soon as theconversation ceased the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock andflew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out beforethem like the bowsprits of a fleet of sail-boats. But Jim was ready for them, and when he saw them coming he turned hisheels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could. bang! But the Wizard was not so confident. They advanced in a great swarm, having been joined by many more oftheir kind, and they flew straight over Jim\\'s head to where the otherswere standing. Half ofthe bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out, so it had been the jarand the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down, more than thefact that it was really hurt. Then a few of themadvanced until another shot from the Wizard\\'s revolver made themretreat. In this way none of them was shocked by thedreadful report more than once, for the main band kept far away andeach time a new company was sent into the battle. When the Wizard hadfired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemyexcept to stun a few by the noise, and so he was no nearer to victorythan in the beginning of the fray. The bound Gargoyle\\'s arms extended far out beyond its head, so bygrasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club. This daunted the enemy for a time, but the defenders were soon out ofbreath. Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a clubuntil he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they clusteredso thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing hisarms. But all this bravery amounted to nothing at all. Eureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the groundlike a streak; but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and grabbed herbefore she had gone very far. The houses of this city had many corners, being square andsix-sided and eight-sided. To one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows, but only onebroad opening far up underneath the roof, the prisoners were brought bytheir captors. \"The space underneath the roof, where they stood, permitted them to seeon all sides of the tall building, and they looked with much curiosityat the city spread out beneath them. Everything visible was made ofwood, and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural. Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search, but nothingmore; so after a time they came back to the platform again. In this country, as in all others they had visited underneath theearth\\'s surface, there was no night, a constant and strong light comingfrom some unknown source. \"All peopleneed rest, even if they are made of wood, and as there is no night herethey select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or doze. \"Where? \"No; she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides ofthis house to the ground. \"Wherever have you been, Eureka?\" \"\"What, the hinges?  \"Do you see that big rock standing on the hillsideyonder?\" he continued, pointing with his finger. \"Well, inside that rock, which reaches up into the clouds, is an archwayvery much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral stairwayfrom the Valley of Voe. They can hear a pin drop. However, the Wizard went once more to hissatchel--which seemed to contain a surprising variety of odds andends--and brought out a spool of strong wire, by means of which theymanaged to fasten four of the wings to Jim\\'s harness, two near his headand two near his tail. So the prisonersresolved to leave their prison at once. The only thing that anyone couldcomplain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled first up andthen down, as if the road were rocky instead of being as smooth as theair could make it. Then he poured over them all the kerosene oil that was left in hisoil-can, and lighting a match set fire to the pile. \"To their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular flightof steps by means of which they could mount to the earth\\'s surface. Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrowgallery where the buggy could not pass. It carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there weregood roads, and since it had accompanied them so far in their travelsthey felt it their duty to preserve it. So Zeb and the Wizard set towork and took off the wheels and the top, and then they put the buggyedgewise, so it would take up the smallest space. It was not a great distance,fortunately, and when the path grew broader they put the buggy togetheragain and proceeded more comfortably. But the road was nothing more thana series of rifts or cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag inevery direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzledas to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than whenthey had started, hours before. \"Once in a while they would come to a deep crack in the floor, which madethe way quite dangerous; but there was still enough oil in the lanternsto give them light, and the cracks were not so wide but that they wereable to jump over them.  But the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last, onturning a sharp corner, the wanderers found themselves in a vast cavearching high over their heads and having a smooth, level floor. The cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to theground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being alwaysside by side. These were motionless at first, but soon began to flickermore brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down. \"Woogh!\" snarled Eureka, arching her back until her hair stood straighton end; \"it\\'s a den of alligators, or crocodiles, or some other dreadfulcreatures! They\\'re uglierthan the Gargoyles. \"Hearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound,and the Wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one ofthe little pockets in the rock. \"Why, it\\'s a dragon!\" \"She has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner. \"No?\" drawled the dragonette; \"it seems to me very babyish. \"Mother\\'s about two thousand years old; but she carelessly lost track ofher age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds. Being reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out oftheir rock-pockets, the children and the Wizard now took time to examinethem more closely. The heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrelsand covered with hard, greenish scales that glittered brightly under thelight of the lanterns. \"For, if we told you truly, you might escape us altogether; and if wetold you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished. \"They circled all around the cavern, keeping a good distance away fromthe blinking yellow eyes of the dragonettes, and presently discoveredthat there were two paths leading from the wall opposite to the placewhere they had entered. They selected one of these at a venture andhurried along it as fast as they could go, for they had no idea when themother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make heracquaintance. Butat length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off thepassage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther. This rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion,turning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot. When first theycame to it there was a solid wall before them; but presently it revolveduntil there was exposed a wide, smooth path across it to the other side. This appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to takeadvantage of it at first, and allowed the rocky wall to swing aroundagain before they had decided to pass over. But they knew now that therewas a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path appearedfor the second time. They heard a crunching, grinding sound, a loud snap, and the turn-tablecame to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path fromwhich they had come. \"\"It is possible,\" agreed the Wizard, \"if this proves to be the path sheusually takes. But I have been examining this tunnel, and I do not seeany signs of so large a beast having passed through it. \"It\\'s enough to have your pedigree flungin your face by those saucy dragonettes.  But their journey was almost over, for in a short time they reached asmall cave from which there was no further outlet. But when the adventurerslooked more carefully around them they discovered that they were in astrong prison from which there was no hope of escape. \"Folks don\\'t fall into the middle of the earth and then getback again to tell of their adventures--not in real life. \"The reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had notenjoyed much exercise lately, and must be tired of their prison in hispocket. So he sat down upon the floor of the cave, brought the pigletsout one by one, and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased. \"The Wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers. \"But I\\'m not, my piggy-wees; I\\'m a humbug wizard. But I am one of the greatest humbugwizards that ever lived, and you will realize this when we have allstarved together and our bones are scattered over the floor of thislonely cave. \"\"Ozma!\" \"Who is Ozma? \"She\\'s afriend of mine, for I met her in the Land of Ev, not long ago, and wentto Oz with her. After you went up in a balloon, and escaped us, I got back toKansas by means of a pair of magical silver shoes. Have you them here with you?\"\"No; I lost them somewhere in the air,\" explained the child. \"\"And were you?\"  \"\"Take us, too!\" \"They are still proud of theirformer Wizard, and often speak of you kindly. \"\"A what?\"\"A sawhorse.  \"\"Pah! Before them were the jewel-studded gates of a magnificent palace, andnow the gates opened slowly as if inviting them to enter the courtyard,where splendid flowers were blooming and pretty fountains shot theirsilvery sprays into the air. OLD FRIENDS ARE REUNITEDMany servants dressed in handsome uniforms stood ready to welcome thenew arrivals, and when the Wizard got out of the buggy a pretty girl ina green gown cried out in surprise:\"Why, it\\'s Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, come back again! Such magnificence andwealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever dreamedof, and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter was realand not tinsel. Zeb was also escorted to a room--so grand and beautiful that he almostfeared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed, lest he might dim theirsplendor. Opening from the chamber was a fine bath-room having a marble tub withperfumed water; so the boy, still dazed by the novelty of hissurroundings, indulged in a good bath and then selected a maroon velvetcostume with silver buttons to replace his own soiled and much wornclothing. There were silk stockings and soft leather slippers withdiamond buckles to accompany his new costume, and when he was fullydressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before inhis life. Taken altogether, it was a dreadfullylong name to weigh down a poor innocent child, and one of the hardestlessons I ever learned was to remember my own name. \"At that time,\" continued the Wizard, busily eating his soup whiletalking, \"there were four separate countries in this Land, each one ofthe four being ruled by a Witch. But the people thought my power wasgreater than that of the Witches; and perhaps the Witches thought sotoo, for they never dared oppose me. Then the Witchesdivided up the kingdom, and ruled the four parts of it until you camehere. The Wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw man,who was an important personage in the Land of Oz. \"I\\'m very certain, Oz, thatyou gave me the best brains in the world, for I can think with them dayand night, when all other brains are fast asleep. ButOzma soon conquered her, with the help of Glinda the Good, and afterthat I went to live with Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman. \"Just then a loud cackling was heard outside; and, when a servant threwopen the door with a low bow, a yellow hen strutted in. Around Billina\\'s neck was a string of beautiful pearls, and on her legswere bracelets of emeralds. \"It keeps finely, being preservedin my air-tight chest. \"Zeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people; butthey were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them verymuch, even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen. \"This I am, in reality, a very big bug, anddoubtless the most intelligent being in all this broad domain. Nobody minded this rudeness, which might have seemed more impolite inone less thoroughly educated; so they straightway forgot him and joinedin a merry conversation that kept them well amused until bed-timearrived. \"The servants were a little discouraged, but soon they brought in a greattray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast. \"Do you take mefor a weasel? How stupid and ignorant you are, in the Land of Oz, andwhat dreadful things you feed upon! \"Oats? In the morning, as soon as it was daylight, he resolved to take a walkand try to find some grass for breakfast; so he ambled calmly throughthe handsome arch of the doorway, turned the corner of the palace,wherein all seemed asleep, and came face to face with the Sawhorse. Jim stopped abruptly, being startled and amazed. The legs of theSawhorse were four sticks driven into holes bored in the log; its tailwas a small branch that had been left by accident and its mouth a placechopped in one end of the body which projected a little and served asa head. [Illustration: \"FOR GOODNESS SAKE, WHAT SORT OF A BEING ARE YOU?\"]Jim\\'s eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse, and he stared atthe creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until itrested against his arched neck. In this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each otherfor a while, each being unable to realize what the singular thing mightbe which it now beheld for the first time. \"\"You are, indeed. theytreat me with great respect.  \" \"Youdo not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you, northe delight of eating delicious food, nor the satisfaction of drawing along breath of fresh, pure air. To be called beautiful was a novelty inhis experience. And this is the Hungry Tiger, the terror of the jungle, who longsto devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from doing so. \"Hearing these words Jim resolved to conquer his alarm. \"If he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he wasmistaken. Some day Iwill let you try to crush in my skull, and afterward you will know moreabout tigers than you do now. \"I thought you were stuffed. THE NINE TINY PIGLETSAfter breakfast Ozma announced that she had ordered a holiday to beobserved throughout the Emerald City, in honor of her visitors. Thepeople had learned that their old Wizard had returned to them and allwere anxious to see him again, for he had always been a rare favorite. The procession was very imposing. First came the Imperial Cornet Band ofOz, dressed in emerald velvet uniforms with slashes of pea-green satinand buttons of immense cut emeralds. They played the National aircalled \"The Oz Spangled Banner,\" and behind them were the standardbearers with the Royal flag. Tik-tok moved by clockwork, and was made all of burnished copper. There followed another band after this, which was called the Royal CourtBand, because the members all lived in the palace. They wore whiteuniforms with real diamond buttons and played \"What is Oz without Ozma\"very sweetly. Then came Professor Woggle-Bug, with a group of students from the RoyalCollege of Scientific Athletics. The boys wore long hair and stripedsweaters and yelled their college yell every other step they took, tothe great satisfaction of the populace, which was glad to have thisevidence that their lungs were in good condition. The brilliantly polished Tin Woodman marched next, at the head of theRoyal Army of Oz which consisted of twenty-eight officers, from Generalsdown to Captains. There were no privates in the army because all were socourageous and skillful that they had been promoted one by one untilthere were no privates left. wanted one of them to pet and play with. Afterward it was noticed that the Wizard always performed his famoustrick with eight piglets, but it seemed to please the people just aswell as if there had been nine of them. There was enough materialthere to enable him to prepare several new tricks which he had learnedfrom some of the jugglers in the circus, and he had passed part of thenight in getting them ready. There was a beautiful canopy for Ozmaand her guests to sit under and watch the people run races and jump andwrestle. \"So they unharnessed Jim and took the saddle off the Sawhorse, and thetwo queerly matched animals were stood side by side for the start. \"\"Go!\" Jim\\'s big hoofs pounded away at a great rate, and although he did notlook very graceful he ran in a way to do credit to his Kentuckybreeding. But the Sawhorse was swifter than the wind. I am sorry to record the fact that Jim was not only ashamed of hisdefeat but for a moment lost control of his temper. As he looked at thecomical face of the Sawhorse he imagined that the creature was laughingat him; so in a fit of unreasonable anger he turned around and made avicious kick that sent his rival tumbling head over heels upon theground, and broke off one of its legs and its left ear. An instant later the Tiger crouched and launched its huge body throughthe air swift and resistless as a ball from a cannon. \"No one must injure one of our friends in our presence,\" growled theLion; and Zeb ran to Jim and whispered that unless he controlled histemper in the future he would probably be torn to pieces. \"There was more applause at this, and then Ozma had the jewelled saddlereplaced upon the Sawhorse and herself rode the victor back to the cityat the head of the grand procession. Jellia at once departed on the errand, and she was gone so long thatthey had almost forgotten her mission when the green robed maidenreturned with a troubled face. \"Your actions alone accuse you. \"They now separated to prepare for the sad ceremony; for whenever anappeal is made to law sorrow is almost certain to follow--even in afairyland like Oz. All the piglets are exactly alike, so no one candispute your word. This deception will save Eureka\\'s life, and then wemay all be happy again. \"After some thought he placed the little pig inside his funnel-shapedhat, and then put the hat upon his head and went back to his room tothink over his speech to the jury. Behind her throne stood thetwenty-eight officers of her army and many officials of the royalhousehold. And now, at a signal from Ozma, the Woggle-Bug arose and addressed thejury. \"Your Royal Highness and Fellow Citizens,\" he began; \"the small cat yousee a prisoner before you is accused of the crime of first murdering andthen eating our esteemed Ruler\\'s fat piglet--or else first eating andthen murdering it. In either case a grave crime has been committed whichdeserves a grave punishment. \"\"Let the Public Accuser continue,\" called Ozma from her throne, \"and Ipray you do not interrupt him. And finally she made a wicked plan tosatisfy her depraved appetite for pork. \"It\\'s blind. \"Very likely,\" acknowledged the Woggle-Bug. \"There was great applause when the speaker sat down. (Here Eureka baredher sharp claws and scratched at the bars of the cage.) \"When the Tin Woodman sat down no one applauded him, for his argumentshad not been very convincing and few believed that he had provedEureka\\'s innocence. If he can produce but seven,then this it not the piglet that was lost, but another one. \"\"Hush, Eureka!\" warned the Wizard. \"Don\\'t be foolish,\" advised the Tin Woodman, \"or you may be sorry forit. At once I jumped up and told thepiglet not to make a fuss, for he would be inside of me in half asecond; but no one can teach one of these creatures to be reasonable. At first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and Ithought I should get him, after all, but he wriggled himself through andfell down into the deep bottom part--and I suppose he\\'s there yet. \"All were astonished at this confession, and Ozma at once sent an officerto her room to fetch the vase. There was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase, sothe Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisonerfree. Ozma gave the Wizard back the piglet he had so kindly allowed NickChopper to substitute for the lost one, and then she carried her owninto the apartments of the palace where she lived. ZEB RETURNS TO THE RANCHEureka was much surprised to find herself in disgrace; but she was, inspite of the fact that she had not eaten the piglet. Then Zeb brought out Jim, all harnessed to the buggy, and took his seat. I think this is the loveliest country in theworld; but not being fairies Jim and I feel we ought to be where webelong--and that\\'s at the ranch. Jim was trotting along thewell-known road, shaking his ears and whisking his tail with a contentedmotion.

       " 58: 'Markov ChainsIntroductionMarkov chains and Monte Carlo Markov chains are mathematical processes that are based on probability and are commonly used in statistics. Monte Carlo Markov chains are a class of algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, leveraging the Markov chain framework to model systems like weather, stock prices, or molecular interactions. A key application is statistical inference - using Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov process to estimate properties of complex distributions and models that cannot be easily analyzed directly. Overall, Markov chains provide a mathematical framework to model random processes over time, while Monte Carlo Markov chains use this to build simulation models for generating sample data from probability distributions of interest across many areas of science, finance, and machine learning. Formulating Markov Chains MathematicallyAt its core, a Markov chain comprises a discrete set of states and transition probabilities between each pair of states. Algorithms like Monte Carlo methods can also simulate trajectories of Markov processes by randomly hopping states guided by the transition probabilities. Monte Carlo MethodThe Monte Carlo method refers to a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The basic concept is to use probability statistics computed from simulations using random number sequences to estimate properties of some process or model. In computer science, Monte Carlo methods are commonly used for risk analysis, optimization, inference, and machine learning. With advances in computational power, Monte Carlo is a versatile, parallelizable, and ever-growing approach for practical stochastic modeling and estimation. Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC)A Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) combines Markov chain sampling with Monte Carlo simulation for efficient numerical analysis and statistical estimation. When combined with random sampling over many independent iterations in the Monte Carlo framework, MCMC allows efficient exploring and learning of the properties of extremely complex high-dimensional probability distributions, used widely from computational physics to modern machine learning. The states traversed form a Markov chain, while the randomness injected through Monte Carlo testing enables broader coverage for improved generalizability. On each turn, you advance a random number of steps based on the rolled dice value. Even far-away spots now have a chance of being visited through random big dice rolls combined with climbing ladders. MCMC stats methods do the same - randomized Monte Carlo dice rolls are combined with Markov Chain ladder climbs to solve problems. The random dice rolls ensure you experience more possibilities to learn the rules better! In summary, MCMC combines targeted but stable Markov Chain exploration with excited dashing about via Monte Carlo randomness - letting you understand big new worlds faster. MCMC in RobotsMonte Carlo Markov chains demonstrate great utility for reinforcement learning algorithms seeking to maximize cumulative rewards by interacting with complex environments. By incorporating randomness to regularly sample exploratory actions during training, the Monte Carlo aspect ensures better coverage for improved policy learning. Blending temporary memoryless state transitions with randomized jumps thus makes Monte Carlo Markov methods exceptionally suitable for reinforcement learning problems.',\n",
       " 59: 'A Markov chain is a random process that moves from one state to another, with the next state depending only on the current state - hence it has the Markov \"memoryless\" property. This is commonly represented as a state transition matrix , where each element  denotes the probability of moving from state  to state  on a given step. The current state combined with  fully parametrizes the next state - encapsulating the memoryless Markov property. Mathematically, if  is a random variable representing the system state at time , then  This formula signifies the conditional distribution of future states depends only on the current state. The Markov property - where the current state encapsulates necessary context - allows generating text word-by-word based on preceding terms. The key advantage of a Markov chain process is that future states depend only on the current state - no historical trajectory is required. This memoryless property allows hopping to completely new states based solely on transition probabilities.',\n",
       " 60: 'A simple example is modeling a sequence of days with sunny or rainy weather, where the weather on a given day is randomly determined based solely on the weather of the previous day. This pure probabilistic approach enables modeling phenomena from physics, biology, and beyond for theoretical and practical insights. This establishes a lightweight, yet versatile approach compared to heavy parameterization with neural networks. By optimizing cumulative future reward, the model learns probable transitions between words reflecting sensible narratives. For example, initializing the state with \"Alice was\" and sampling subsequent actions as words yield:\"Alice was heading to the store when...\"\"Alice was shocked to discover that...\"\"Alice was running late for her appointment...\"The model associates those sentences starting with the phrase \"Alice was\" which commonly transitions towards other verbs or plot-advancing events. Their efficient yet effective learning drives adoptions in chatbots for dialog modeling or summarization systems for extracting key points - producing sensible language output without laborious feature engineering. A very simple example is estimating  - we could generate random (x,y) points on a square enclosed in a circle and count what fraction falls inside the circle to estimate its area relative to the square. As the number of samples increases, the estimate converges to , based on area geometry. Common applications include pathfinding, decision tree learning, and evaluating multidimensional integrals in physics simulations that are too complex to solve analytically. The algorithms are useful since they are often easier to implement than deriving explicit solutions while providing great flexibility. Together they provide a versatile yet lightweight framework to model real-world stochastic processes like financial trends, genome sequencing, and social networks. MCMC in layman\\'s termsMCMC is like playing a board game to explore new places. Imagine you are playing Snakes and Ladders. Your piece starts at the beginning. Where you land next depends only on your current spot - if you land at the bottom of a ladder, you climb up and advance faster! Now let us add dice rolling like in Monopoly. This randomness helps you explore more spots, not only the connected ones. This way you get to know the board better compared to moving along just adjacent squares! It allows studying huge complex game boards by directly hopping between interesting features through many simulated traversals, something too long by standard play. Consider training a robot to navigate obstacle courses. The state space encoding positions and sensor data are enormous - far too large to explore exhaustively in a reasonable time. After sufficient simulation iterations, high-reward state-action sequences are discovered without prohibitively expensive physical trial-and-error. ',\n",
       " 61: 'Based on P, foundational Markov chain analysis provides equilibria, stationary distributions, ergodic behaviors, and other statistical properties. Consider a Markov chain text model that gives higher rewards for coherent sentences conforming to grammar and lower rewards otherwise. Their synergy thereby expands the scope and scalability for statistical analysis. This is like a Markov Chain, where you hop directly between connected spots based on set rules. Instead, a Markov chain model is created to hop between proximate states based on a learned policy, avoiding obstacles while progressing toward goal locations that yield rewards. The robot simulates experience by traversing the Markov chain policy, integrating rewards over time to refine decisions.',\n",

I believe the benchmark and comparisons should be done by an independent third party to assure its credibility.\",\n",

sup plement existing learning material s2 said student use chatgpt find resource online student use gai tool avoid busy work asked motivates student use tool student fre quently use expressed likely use gai tool assisting even completing assignment perceived meaningless mere busy work student 412 compared existing tool calculator whose introduction classroom allowed student progress towards advanced topic faster reduce amount time student spend familiar task could considered tedious 46 according student refers work take much time little academic benefit arent passionate participant s2 remarked kind work use chatgpt saying chatgpt could kind busy work anything could figure like couple minute gai tool shift focus higher level abstraction student expressed 612 gai tool could help reduce amount time spent working lower level abstraction student often gave example gai tool could shift learner focus toward higherlevel skill eg design anal ysis evaluation code advanced software engineering concept student likely encounter later computing course example participant s9 described student might focus design pattern software design rather implementation detail left summarized theme student interview presented right summarized theme instructor interview presented dont usually get design pattern graduate school right unless youd specifically seek outwe could use chatgpt help teach design pattern use chatgpt tool implement little piece going try break larger problem figure pattern applies use whatever need use generate individual piece code really care overall structure making sure student kind broader understanding piece software rather single algorithm single piece code smaller scale program gai tool provide alternative perspective source assistance another common theme amongst student regularly use gai tool tool provide another source assistance outside instructor teaching assistant 412 reason student said choose use tool chatgpt rather asking instructor teaching assistant professor good explaining course con cepts code s4 s5gai tool provide multiple alternative perspec tives programming concept s5 s10 gai tool convenient source assistance instructor ta s5 s8 s4 described time wished able use gai tool order get help concept one computing course especially found searching different perspective felt instructor wasnt communicating needed professor dont know communicate answer youre looking lot trouble wrapping head around asked context use linked list instructor explained linked list wa chatgpt feel like could say give example linked list would implement language b concern gai tool rq2 student largely expressed excitement gai tool benefit computing education student also expressed amount trepidation concern regarding use computing education concern overreliance student 912 men tioned potential student develop overreliance tool concern specifically student 612 detailed concern quality education student receive become overreliant gai tool dont adequately explain response specific con cerns overreliance quality education student may develop understanding terial get assistance gai tool s1 s4 s5 s9 s11 s12 following quote participant illustrate student concern participant s1 said using dont really fully understand theyre telling kind like oh im really one learning really digesting whats happening got conclusion participant s4 provided additional perspective saying feel like lot people heavily rely use copy paste work necessarily understand feel like would copy work given kind ruin purpose learning first place concern trustworthiness majority student 712 also expressed concern trustworthiness output given gai tool student raised concern reliability information generated model due potential misinform student specifically student outlined following concern trustworthiness information source missing incorrect s1 s8 s9 gai tool tend hallucinate information s6 s8 s10 student doublecheck everything infor

dont really know yet like google replacement feel like useful really know topic youre talking like read saying sure like meaningless output sometimes search google make sure said correct participant s4 also described needing check response correctness sharing wouldnt stop using gai tool altogether prevents relying tool much incorrect chatgpt response wouldnt keep using small detail concern academic integrity student expressed belief amount plagia rism increase tool become popular however student necessarily believe aiaided plagiarism different plagiarism occurred previously student claimed difference plagiarizing copying someone el work paying subscription service chegg using tool like chatgpt free available everyone ive seen people use thing like chegg straight finish homework feel like difference using chatgpt free service give information want could probably change couple thing versus paying fee subscriptionbased service host work professor giving s4 c predicted implication gai tool rq3 student excited share insight course curriculum assessment methodology adapted accommodate gai tool instructor responsible adapting course interview none student said instructor ban use gai tool contrary multiple student 512 expressed instructor responsible adapting course way work new technology instructor past innovative popular technology calculator wikipedia

would possibly lower lab weight maybe increase exam weight know thing tested person feel like shouldnt like kind benefit like know able use google like 4050 like lab weight able use google learn read lot documentation know actually kind somewhat suffer lab also knew lab grade would save wasnt good exam s8 instructor must focus student engagement several student 312 specifically mentioned learning new material handson activelearning assignment helpful engaging student 412 emphasized believed engaging course coursework would likely result engaged student see value wantto complete assignment le likely plagiarize participant s1 said following instructor need understand student use chatgpt first place reason use dont understand content want easy mean something going wrong curriculum thats presented instructor incorporate gai tool class student excited potential instructor include model curriculum student suggested instructor could focus le implementation detail highlevel concept participant s5 pointed importance skill learned early programming course particularly problemsolving think learning language easiest part think introductory programming course offer something little bit important problemsolving think still important part programming thats really programming problemsolving problemsolving mindset definitely something cannot assumed people student 412 also suggested instructor could teach student use gai tool teaching student best way prompt tool chatgpt limitation risk using tool couple student also suggested instructor could use gai tool scaffold learning described detail participant s5 like asking mathematician mundane repetitive math equation today without calcula tor really think instructor know start teaching student know everything without ai

participant i2 described theyve student use chatgpt try find weakness area improvement essay project proposal gai tool low cost accessibility provide stu dent high quality learning resource couple instructor 26 expressed excitement low cost barrier entry provide student resource prohibitively expensive private tutor paid service chegg coursehero additionally gai tool could act high quality learning resource outside student instructor ta providing another perspective course topic b concern gai tool rq2 instructor hold many common concern regarding ai sys tems use generative ai computing education use student concern trustworthiness instructor 56 cited lack trustworthiness response gai tool one primary concern instructor mentioned important doublecheck informa tion received model however one instructor pointed student dont always necessary foun dational knowledge know whether output right wrong participant i4 said dont know chatgpt giving student right information know know topic know im getting bogus information dont know thats concern concern overreliance several instructor 36 also cited overreliance significant concern consid ering student using model class participant i3 expressed concern student fully learning material rely heavily gai tool participant i1 i3 expressed concern student may lose important skill writing become reliant model participant i5 discussed concern gai tool replacing student effort sayingi think pedagogically well kind go back drawing board necessarily prevent student using benefiting tool mean embrace change new method new way thing find way student use thing assist help one replaces cognitive load concern academic integrity instructor 66 ex pressed concern student using gai tool plagiarize several instructor 46 expressed due availability low cost tool like chatgpt student likely plagiarize however one instructor i5 said feel like student wa never motivated cheat first place chatgpt available sufficiently motivated student would always cheated lazily assume uptick number student exploiting tool uptick number student cheating result tool would middle always willing perhaps lack time resource access knowhow properly engage dont think giant movement towards student would done otherwise dont think turning student cheater think making accessible already would done participant insight aligns perspective shared instructor concern academic integrity arisen due presence gai tool classroom le focused stopping student cheating unlikely rather developing way instructor disincentivize cheating c predicted implication gai tool rq3 instructor shared uncertainty exactly need change course design assessment method however emphasized importance proactively incorporating model computing education curriculum gai tool incorporated classroom unanimously instructor 66 emphasized believe gai tool banned embrace existence include classroom instructor believed wa imperative understand tool work way envisioned incorporating gai tool course included let student use able explain output correct incorrect i1 i3 i6 clearly articulate student need know without using gai tool i4 participant i4 detailed new tool shift course taught clear expectation student need established calculator thing used expect student memorize multiplication division table know calculator came course know reasonable expect people memorize know theyve got tool use figure multiply thing know could see thing happening u programming tool like chatgpt exist know maybe certain thing could expect student use tool dont test time know ha core level knowledge expect student know without use tool gai tool facilitate critical thinking couple instructor 26 excited potential use model course help student develop critical thinking analysis skill participant i6 said let actually use chatgpt come back report first draft sense useful student develop critical thinking instead like old way writing report give code code give sort analysis match fit thing easily templatetized something easily described describable instructor need update assessment method term update curriculum adapt course account existence model instructor clear idea exactly needed done many expressing uncertainty best way ass student progress prevent plagiarism ensure student rely heavily model hindering education interview instructor mention
